In recent years, Visibility Graph (VG) methods have been widely used for analyzing biological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), demonstrating promising results. This paper introduces a novel MI-BCI system based on VG analysis. Our proposed method for classifying left- and right-hand motor imagery consists of two approaches: global and local. In the global approach, each EEG channel is transformed into a graph, and fifteen features are extracted. This graph-based transformation preserves the complex relationships within EEG signals, enhancing the feature extraction process. The features are then reduced using the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method, which improves computational efficiency and reduces overfitting risks. The classification is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). In the local approach, each trial is divided into three segments, and each segment is converted into a graph with fifteen extracted features. The mRMR method is again applied for feature selection, and classification is performed on each segment, with majority voting determining the final class. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the global approach, achieving mean accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score of 74.62%, 76.36%, 74.77%, and 74.74%, respectively, for the classification of motor imagery tasks involving left- and right-hand movements. A comparison with previous studies using the same dataset confirms the superior performance of the proposed method.",Brain computer interface | Electroencephalography | Motor imagery | Visibility graph,0,1,all publisherhybridgold,All Open Access Hybrid Gold,,,

A comprehensive assessment of ICRG regulatory patterns was conducted in SKCM samples using single-cell spatial transcriptomic and multi-omics data. These patterns were correlated with tumor microenvironment (TME) cell infiltration characteristics to construct ICRG scores quantifying tumor-specific ICRG modification patterns. The ICRG.Gene.cluster stratifies samples into two distinct subpopulations representing divergent immune phenotypes. An ICRG scoring system is constructed based on ICRG phenotype genes and validated in independent cohorts. Through ICRG-associated gene profiling, CD8⁺ T cells are categorized into five subsets, all exhibiting significant temporal dynamics in pseudotime analysis. Spatial transcriptomics confirms prominent co-localization spots between the C3 CD8⁺ T cell subset and melanoma cells. SCENIC analysis identifies that specific ICRG genes function as target nodes regulated by transcription factors. Core ICRG genes demonstrate elevated expression in both cell lines and clinical specimens, supporting their potential role as disease-associated genetic risk loci.

Despite our understanding of pathophysiology, potential biomarkers and early detection are still very limited. Hence, there is an urgent need to find the potent molecular biomarker of Glaucoma so that early diagnosis and personalised glaucoma treatment can be possible. In this study, we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses to discern differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked with Glaucoma. The aim is to find a robust candidate biomarker to facilitate early diagnosis and characterisation of Glaucoma. Advanced feature selections are performed by employing DEG identification and machine learning algorithms, enabling the selection of highly prognostic relevance genes. Furthermore, Artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to recognise the complicated nonlinear patterns within high-dimensional data and identify the most promising genes having a potent role in glaucoma progression and risk prediction. After the analysis, NPM1P51 turned out to be the most significant contributor after performing multiple analyses, suggesting it to be a strong pseudogene biomarker. Further, CACNG7 showed moderate results in Garson and Olden plots, but better in Generalised weight plots. It encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex, aligning with already established roles in the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in glaucoma, particularly in apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells through calcium dysregulation.

While individual compounds may exhibit distinct pharmacological properties in isolation, their behaviour within molecular clusters often diverges, potentially leading to emergent synergistic effects. Leveraging this insight, we systematically analysed 490 phytoconstituents derived from ten medicinal plants belonging to the Dasamoola group. Through chemoinformatic clustering using K-Means and dimensionality reduction via t-SNE, these molecules were organised into 49 structurally coherent clusters. Pharmacological relevance was assessed by mapping clusters to 87 ICD-11-classified disease conditions, thereby integrating clustering, ICD-11 mapping, and knowledge-graph visualization into a unified workflow that can serve as a template for analysing other complex polyherbal formulations. Heat map analyses revealed significant correlations between molecular clusters and disease phenotypes, indicating potential poly pharmacological mechanisms. To further elucidate these relationships, predicted molecular targets were integrated with disease ontologies using a Neo4j-based knowledge graph framework. This network-based approach enabled the visualization of molecule–target–disease associations, suggesting mechanistic insights that extend beyond conventional reductionist perspectives in an exploratory manner. Overall, our findings suggest potential molecular–target–disease associations that link structurally related phytochemicals to defined disease categories through shared biological targets. These associations indicate plausible network-level relationships and offer new avenues for, understanding the systems-level pharmacology of traditional medicinal formulations, generating testable hypothesis that warrant further experimental validation.",AI-based therapeutic mapping | Chemical space analysis | K means clustering | Molecular clustering | Neo4j knowledge graph,0,0,,,NITC,,National Institute of Technology Calicut

This study explores a novel biology-driven radiomic strategy focusing on AKR1B10. AKR1B10 is a functionally established molecular driver of HCC progression, and the study aims to develop an interpretable prediction model bridging imaging phenotypes and underlying tumor biology. Methods: We analyzed multi-institutional data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). After confirming the prognostic significance of AKR1B10 expression through survival and enrichment analyses, we developed a radiomics model using a cohort of 34 patients with matched computed tomography (CT) images and genomic data. Tumor and peritumoral regions were segmented, and 107 radiomic features were extracted. Feature selection was performed using maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (mRMR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithms, with subsequent model building via logistic regression. The model was evaluated using ROC analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Finally, we constructed a prognostic nomogram integrating the radiomics signature with clinical variables. Results: AKR1B10 overexpression was significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR = 2.187, 95 % CI: 1.385–3.454, P < 0.001) and characteristic activation of oncogenic pathways. The radiomics model demonstrated strong performance in predicting AKR1B10 status (AUC = 0.83, 95 % CI: 0.69–0.97), with significant difference in rad-scores between AKR1B10 high- and low-expression groups (P < 0.001). The integrated nomogram showed excellent predictive accuracy for 3-year survival (AUC = 0.85) and provided clinical net benefit across threshold probabilities. Conclusions: The biology-informed radiomics model based on AKR1B10 expression demonstrates strong prognostic performance in hepatocellular carcinoma. By directly linking imaging phenotypes to a key molecular driver of HCC, this approach provides a clinically applicable and biologically interpretable tool for pre-operative risk prediction.",AKR1B10 | Computed tomography | Hepatocellular carcinoma | Prognosis | Radiomics model,0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,25ywb151,Taizhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a scalable and interpretable MOEA framework tailored for large-scale cancer subtype classification. The algorithm incorporates a strategic partitioning of genetic features into convergence-related and diversity-related subsets, supported by an interaction analysis that groups correlated features. A distributed island model further enhances computational scalability and maintains solution diversity through localized optimization and controlled migration. Final solutions are refined using non-dominated sorting to balance the four objectives: classification accuracy, feature subset size, feature relevance, and feature redundancy. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing MOEAs, yielding compact and robust gene subsets with improved generalizability and biological interpretability.

In this study, we employed machine learning methods to analyze RNA-seq data from patients with four different types of cancers and two immune cell types, including T cell and CD45+CD3− leukocyte cell types. We processed seven datasets, each divided into three groups on the basis of cell source: tumor, normal adjacent tissue, and peripheral blood. The datasets were downscaled by using the Boruta method, and the remaining genes were ranked for criticality in a list through the max-relevance and min-redundancy method. The obtained list of genes was fed into incremental feature selection (IFS), which employed decision tree or random forest to distinguish cells, for the identification of key genes associated with immune cell function in different cancer types and construction of efficient classifiers and classification rules (special patterns for different groups). Our results revealed distinct expression patterns of key genes, such as the downregulation of CST7 in T cells from tumor tissues and differential expression of CD2 in non-tumor sites. Furthermore, we identified LCP1, CD27, and MAL as immunologically relevant genes in T cells across different tissue origins, whereas IFI30, CXCR4, and FOSB played various roles in CD45+CD3− leukocytes. The identified key genes were supported by evidence in the literature, highlighting their involvement in antitumor processes in T cells and other immune cells.

Differential expression analysis identified a series of differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) among multiple age group comparisons, with the most significant expression changes observed between the youngest (18–27 years) and older (68–77 years) age groups. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of target genes indicated that these lncRNAs were involved in mitochondrial function, telomere maintenance, and pathways related to neurodegenerative disease.

The candidates were four groups of scalar and vector features drawn from the hyperspectral images (HIS) of the SW1353 chondrosarcoma line whose selection was guided by criteria including features relevance, cross entropy loss, robustness, running times, memory usage, and overall classification accuracy. The best results are obtained for six scalar features restricted to 415–460 nm spectral window. The associated ML classifier is subsequently used to compare the specific changes provoked by X-rays and carbon-ions by the help of the distance metric in the probability space where sorting is formally considered the action of prediction operators. We introduce the concept of confusion domain as a suitable approach able to disclose different shifts of the spectral features of SW1353 cells by type of irradiation. The findings exhibit consistency across all sections of the confusion domain thus supporting the conclusions on the different effects of radiation type. The results indicate that REF class is closer to XR class than to CI class and consequently X-rays produce weaker changes to the relevant spectral properties compared to carbon-ions. The biological resilience of the cells’ nuclei is higher against X-rays than against carbon-ions irradiation. The practical significance of our study lies in demonstrating the possibility to automate the decision-making process in measuring the amplitude of the ionizing radiation effects at single cell level, using HSI of unstained nuclei, with potential impact in radiotherapy of radioresistant cells.",Chondrosarcoma cells | Confusion domain | Distances in probability space | Hyperspectral images | Ionizing radiation | ML classifiers | Scalar and vector features,1,1,all publisherhybridgold,All Open Access Hybrid Gold,,107066,"Ministry of Education and Research, Romania"

Differentially expressed GTRGs were identified, prognostic candidates were screened by univariate Cox regression, and a nine-gene prognostic signature was constructed using LASSO–Cox regression with 10-fold cross-validation; risk stratification was evaluated in both cohorts. Single-cell RNA-seq data (GSE132257) were analyzed to quantify GTRG activity across cell types, infer epithelial state transitions, and characterize GTRG-associated cell–cell communication within the TME. The immune landscape and tumor mutational burden (TMB) were assessed for risk-group comparisons. Spatial transcriptomics was used to localize key candidates and infer regional metabolic pathway activity. CHPF was prioritized as a core candidate based on multi-omics evidence and further experimentally validated to support its biological relevance and prognostic implication in CRC. Results: Single-cell analysis revealed pronounced heterogeneity in GTRG activity across cell types, with the highest scores observed in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and B cells. GT^high epithelial cells exhibited intensified crosstalk with immune and stromal populations and were enriched for cancer-associated signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K–Akt, TGF-β, and Notch. In bulk cohorts, 88 dysregulated GTRGs supported derivation of a nine-gene signature that stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct clinical and molecular features. High-risk tumors showed an altered immune landscape, higher TMB, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metabolic reprogramming. Spatial analysis highlighted CHPF as a tumor-enriched GTRG co-localized with regions enriched for inferred metabolic pathway activity, particularly N-glycan biosynthesis. Functional assays confirmed that CHPF promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusions: This multi-omics framework links GTRG programs to immune–metabolic remodeling and prognosis in CRC and highlights CHPF as a potential driver. The nine-gene signature may facilitate risk stratification and inform precision oncology strategies.",CHPF | Colorectal cancer | Glycosyltransferase related gene | Immune landscape | Prognosis,0,0,,,NNSFC,82260543,National Natural Science Foundation of China

This study investigated whether patterns of inter-regional glucose uptake coordination, derived from whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT, could reveal latent subclinical metabolic phenotypes among normoglycemic adults. Methods: We analyzed 536 clinically normoglycemic adults (fasting blood glucose < 6.1 mmol/L) who underwent whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT. For each subject, pairwise lean body mass normalized standardized uptake value ratios (SUL<inf>r</inf>) across 20 anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs) were calculated and adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction followed by Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) was applied to identify latent phenotypes. Cluster separation and assignment certainty were evaluated using silhouette scores and posterior entropy. Between-phenotype SUL<inf>r</inf> patterns were compared, and population-level inter-regional metabolic networks were constructed from covariate-adjusted residuals using bootstrap-stabilized Pearson correlations. To assess biological relevance, individuals with prediabetes (n = 465) and diabetes (n = 148) were embedded into the same analytic framework. Results: Two distinct metabolic phenotypes were identified within the normoglycemic cohort (Phenotype A and Phenotype B), with no significant differences in age, sex, BMI, or fasting blood glucose. Phenotype A was characterized by lower myocardium-to-peripheral ratios (versus adipose, skeletal muscle, and lung) and higher brain-to-myocardium and brain-to-fat ratios compared to Phenotype B. At the network level, Phenotype A showed stronger positive correlations between myocardial and peripheral uptakes, indicating tighter systemic coupling despite reduced relative cardiac allocation. These patterns qualitatively mirrored those observed in prediabetic and diabetic groups. Conclusion: Whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT identified metabolically distinct phenotypes in adults with normal fasting glucose, differentiated by both pairwise uptake ratios and systemic network coordination. These findings highlight latent metabolic heterogeneity in clinically healthy individuals and provide a basis for future investigations into early systemic metabolic alterations.",18F-FDG | Clustering | Diabetics | Gaussian mixture model | Metabolic phenotyping | Normoglycemia | Whole-body PET/CT,0,0,,,NNSF,2023B1515120007,Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province

Tregs are key mediators of immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are closely associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, defining and characterizing tumors with predominant Treg-mediated immunosuppression is essential for optimizing the use of Treg-targeted and combination immunotherapies. Methods: We applied an unsupervised multi-omics integration approach across four molecular layers — mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and proteomics —to identify immunologically distinct subtypes of breast cancer. Autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction followed by consensus clustering revealed a subgroup characterized by high Treg infiltration and immunosuppressive signaling, referred to as the Treg-enriched subtype. To evaluate therapeutic strategies, we employed a spatial quantitative systems pharmacology (spQSP) model simulating tumor–immune dynamics and tested Treg-targeted and PD-1 blockade therapies both alone and in combination. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted using the EMT6 syngeneic breast tumor model, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, assessing the antitumor effects of a CCR8-targeted small molecule (IPG7236) as monotherapy or in combination with anti–PD-L1 treatment. Results: The C2 cluster exhibited elevated Treg-related signatures and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. A similar Treg-enriched cluster was also identified in an independent cohort, supporting the robustness and clinical relevance of this immunosuppressive subtype. In-silico simulations performed under a C2-like, immunosuppressive context predicted that combining Treg-targeted therapy with PD-1 blockade would substantially enhance immune activation and tumor control compared with monotherapy. To experimentally validate these predictions, combination treatment of a CCR8 inhibitor (IPG7236) and anti–PD-L1 antibody demonstrated greater tumor growth inhibition than either monotherapy in the EMT6 model, confirming the predicted therapeutic synergy in Treg-enriched, immune-suppressive tumors. Conclusion: This study identifies Treg-enriched and immunosuppressive breast cancer subtype through integrative multi-omics analysis and demonstrates, through both in-silico and in-vivo approaches, the therapeutic potential of combining Treg-targeted and PD-L1 blockade therapies. These findings highlight Treg-mediated immunosuppression as a key determinant of therapeutic responsiveness, providing a biological rationale for patient stratification and guiding the development of personalized combination strategies for clinical translation.",breast cancer | immunosuppressive tumormicroenvironment | multi-omics | patient stratification | regulatory T cells (Tregs) | translational oncology,0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

These selected genes are then used to train an LSTM model, capturing complex interactions between gene expression patterns. Using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering, we group genes with similar expression profiles. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Silhouette Score. To refine the model, we introduce a feedback loop where cluster labels are fed back into the LSTM as additional features, enhancing the model’s ability to detect significant gene associations. We compare various network architectures to assess their impact on clustering performance. Finally, enrichment analysis reveals key biological pathways, such as immune regulation and protein signaling, related to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

This processing may provide scaling issues that limit the implementation of these types of data into research as well as integrated diagnostics in routine care. Here, we investigate whether we can use existing dimension reduction techniques to provide visualisations and analyses for a complete bloodcount (CBC) while maintaining representativeness of the original data. We considered over 3 million CBC measurements encompassing over 70 parameters of cell frequency, size and complexity from the UMC Utrecht UPOD database. We evaluated PCA as an example of a linear dimension reduction techniques and UMAP, TriMap and PaCMAP as non-linear dimension reduction techniques. We assessed their technical performance using quality metrics for dimension reduction as well as biological representation by evaluating preservation of diurnal, age and sex patterns, cluster preservation and the identification of leukemia patients. Results: We found that, for clinical hematology data, PCA performs systematically better than UMAP, TriMap and PaCMAP in representing the underlying data. Biological relevance was retained for periodicity in the data. However, we also observed a decrease in predictive performance of the reduced data for both age and sex, as well as an overestimation of clusters within the reduced data. Finally, we were able to identify the diverging patterns for leukemia patients after use of dimensionality reduction methods. Conclusions: We conclude that for hematology data, the use of unsupervised dimension reduction techniques should be limited to data visualization applications, as implementing them in diagnostic pipelines may lead to decreased quality of integrated diagnostics in routine care.",Clustering | Data preservation | Dimension reduction | Haematology | Routine care data,1,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with IA from November 2015 to March 2024 were recruited from two independent centers (center 1, training and internal test data set; center 2, external test data set). TLS was divided into two groups according to hematoxylin-eosin staining. Radiomic features were extracted, and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented to predict the status of TLSs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze diagnostic performance. Furthermore, visual assessments of the test set were also conducted by two thoracic radiologists and compared with the radiomics results. Results: A total of 456 patients were included (training data set, n = 278; internal test data set, n = 115; external test data set, n = 63). The area under the curve (AUC) of the radiomics model on the validation set, the internal test set, and the external test set were 0.781 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.659–0.905;), 0.804 (95% CI: 0.723–0.884;) and 0.747 (95% CI: 0.621–0.874;), respectively. In the visual assessments, the mean CT value and air bronchogram were important indicators of TLS, the AUC was 0.683. In the external test set, the AUC of the clinical model was 0.632. Conclusions: The radiomics model has a higher AUC than the clinical model and effectively discriminates TLSs in patients with IA. Critical relevance statement: This study demonstrates that the radiomics-based model can differentiate TLSs in patients with IA. As a non-invasive biomarker, it enhances our understanding of tumor prognosis and management. Key Points: TLSs are closely related to favorable clinical outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer.

However, the predictive power and interpretability of these methods remain inadequate for clinical translation, primarily due to limited generalization across high-dimensional SNP datasets. This study addresses the contested diagnostic utility of SNPs by integrating interpretable feature selection with deep learning to enhance both classification performance and biological relevance. Methods: We propose an interpretable deep feature selection framework designed to enhance both the classification performance and biological relevance of SNP markers in distinguishing between benign and malignant prostate cancer samples. This study specifically investigates the debated diagnostic value of SNPs in PCa classification by integrating feature selection with deep learning to uncover actionable insights. Specifically, our framework comprises four key components: (1) Heuristic feature reduction, which eliminates irrelevant SNPs during gradient computation for training deep neural networks (DNNs); (2) Iterative SNP subset optimization, aiming at maximizing classification AUC during model training; (3) Gradient variance minimization, mitigating instability caused by limited sample sizes; and (4) Nonlinear interaction modeling, which extracts high-level SNP interactions through hierarchical representations. Results: Evaluated on the PLCO, BPC3, and MEC-AA datasets, our method achieved mean AUC scores of 0.747, 0.751, and 0.559, respectively, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05, a paired t-test) over existing approaches. Notably, the lower AUC for MEC-AA may reflect inherent population-specific complexities, as this dataset focuses on African American men, a group historically underrepresented in genomic studies. For interpretability, our framework identified 345, 373, and 437 consensus SNP markers across the PLCO, BPC3, and MEC-AA cohorts, respectively. Key SNPs were further validated against prior research on PCa racial disparities: rs10086908 and rs2273669 (PLCO); rs12284087, rs902774, rs9364554, and rs7611694 (BPC3); and rs3123078 and rs1447295 (MEC-AA) exhibited strong concordance with established loci linked to ethnic-specific risk profiles. For instance, rs1447295 on chromosome 8q24, recurrently associated with African ancestry, underscores the method’s ability to recover population-relevant variants.

Celluar senescence plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis and shaping the immune landscape. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of tumor metabolism and biological behavior, and identifying senescence-associated miRNA (CS-miRNA) signatures is critical for improving prognosis and guiding treatment strategies. Methods We proformed multiomics analysis on 616 ccRCC samples from the TCGA-KIRC dataset and developed a CS-miRNA-based scoring system(CS-miRNAs-Score) using machine learning algorithms to evaluate clinical and immunological characteristics. The model was externally validated with miRNA-seq data from 21 clinical ccRCC samples. Based on CS-miRNA expression profiles, patients were stratified into two distinct clusters with significantly different clinical outcomes, mutation profiles,and biological pathways. Results The CS-miRNAs-Score,comprising 10 prognostically relevant miRNAs, was significantly associated with overall survival, immune and stromal scores, immune checkpoint expression response to immunotherapy. In addition, we constructed a miRNA-mRNA interaction network and experimentally validated the tumor-suppressive role of hsa-miR-130a-3p in ccRCC. Functional assays, including CCK-8, Transwell migration, scratch wound healing, and dual-luciferase reporter assays, confirmed that has-miR-130a-3p directly binds to and inhibits SPOCK1, an oncogene in ccRCC.

Methods: This retrospective multicentre study enrolled treatment-naive HCC patients undergoing initial TACE from two independent cohorts: the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (training cohort) and Wenzhou Central Hospital (external validation cohort). Through recursive feature elimination (RFE), we systematically developed prediction models employing ten distinct ML algorithms. The SHAP algorithm was implemented to enhance model interpretability, while patient stratification was subsequently performed using PCA and K-means clustering to facilitate comprehensive prognostic analysis. Results: We retrospectively collected 382 unresectable HCC patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and 52 from Wenzhou Central Hospital. RFE method identified 10 predictors for constructing ML models. XGBoost and CatBoost outperformed other algorithms, achieving AUCs of 0.796–0.799 (internal test) and 0.785–0.791 (external validation) with balanced accuracy (76-76.8%). SHAP interpretability revealed tumor burden and hepatic function markers as key determinants of TACE resistance. K-means clustering stratified patients into two prognostically distinct subgroups: Cluster B showed significantly longer survival than Cluster A (HR = 0.36, 95%CI:0.26–0.49, P < 0.001), confirming the clinical relevance of ML-selected features. Conclusion: We developed and validated an interpretable ML-based system integrating predictive modelling and patient clustering to individualize TACE efficacy prediction and clinical risk stratification for HCC patients.",Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) | Machine learning | Prognostic model | Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE),0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NNSF,81972233,National Natural Science Foundation of China

This case-control study included 203 prostate cancer cases and 54 population-based controls. Serum samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR (performed at QIAGEN Genomic Services). Total RNA was extracted from 200 µl of serum using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Advanced Kit and reverse-transcribed with the miRCURY LNA RT Kit. A panel of 46 candidate miRNAs was profiled, and feature selection was performed using LASSO penalization. Logistic regression models were used to estimate age- and covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between miRNA expression and prostate cancer risk. Predictive performance was assessed using repeated 5-fold cross-validation with bootstrap resampling (10 repetitions; 1000 resamples), and summarized using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with bias-corrected 95% CIs. Fourteen miRNAs were significantly associated with prostate cancer. Notably, miR-199a-5p (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13–3.15; p = 0.015) and miR-150-5p (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06–0.63; p = 0.006) showed consistent differential expression across all Gleason risk categories, with miR-199a-5p overexpressed and miR-150-5p underexpressed, suggesting a potential role in disease progression. miR-145-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-93-5p were significantly associated with prostate cancer in both the overall model and in low- and intermediate-risk strata, highlighting their potential relevance in early-stage disease. In contrast, miR-24-3p was exclusively overexpressed in high-risk prostate cancer (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.43–5.98; p = 0.003), indicating a possible link with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Predictive models demonstrated strong discriminatory performance, particularly for the low-risk group (AUC = 0.930, 95% CI: 0.882–0.979), followed by the intermediate-risk (AUC = 0.806, 95% CI: 0.728–0.883) and high-risk groups (AUC = 0.752, 95% CI: 0.658–0.848).

This study identifies key circulating miRNAs associated with prostate cancer and demonstrates their potential in predictive models for risk stratification. The strongest discriminatory performance was observed in low-risk tumors (AUC = 0.930), followed by intermediate- (AUC = 0.806) and high-risk (AUC = 0.752) categories.

Despite therapeutic advancements, OSCC mortality rates have been increasing, underscoring the need for improved prognostic models and therapeutic targets. Methods: We integrated transcriptomic and clinical survival data from the TCGA-OSCC dataset to identify ferroptosis-related prognostic genes. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we selected genes associated with OSCC prognosis and applied Lasso regression analysis to pinpoint key genes. A prognostic model was constructed and validated through survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: WGCNA identified modules significantly correlated with ferroptosis, yielding 321 genes associated with OSCC prognosis. Univariate Cox analysis identified 13 genes affecting OSCC prognosis. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression narrowed down the gene set to a final set of 7 genes, which were used to construct the risk model. The model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant survival differences (P < 0.001). The model's predictive accuracy was validated, with AUC values ranging from 0.565 to 0.733 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival predictions. Immune-related analysis revealed that low-risk patients exhibited higher immune cell infiltration and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion: Our study presents a novel prognostic model for OSCC patients based on ferroptosis-related genes, which not only predicts survival but also identifies potential therapeutic targets.

Methods: This paper presents a protein–protein interaction (PPI)-informed hybrid model that combines multi-omics profiles, including RNA expression, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression, with a Graph Attention Network (GAT), Random Forest (RF), and logistic stacking ensemble learning. The proposed model utilizes ElasticNet-based feature selection to obtain the most informative biomarkers across omics layers, and the GAT module learns the biologically significant topological representations in the PPI network. The Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to mitigate the class imbalance, and the model performance was assessed using a repeated five-fold stratified cross-validation approach using the following performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and AUPRC. Results: The findings illustrate that a combination of multi-omics data increases subtype classification rates (up to 0.984 ± 0.012) more than single-omics methods, and DNA methylation proves to be the most discriminative modality. In addition, analysis of interpretability using attention revealed the major subtype-specific biomarkers, including UBA2, LRRC41, ANKRD53, and WDR77, that show great biological relevance and could be used as diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Many existing gene selection methods fail to produce stable and consistent results, especially when training data are limited. To address this, we propose a multi-task ensemble strategy that combines repeated sampling with joint feature selection and classification. The method generates multiple training subsets and applies multi-task logistic regression with (Formula presented.) group sparsity regularization to select a subset of genes that appears consistently across tasks. This promotes stability and reduces redundancy. The framework supports integration with standard classifiers such as logistic regression and support vector machines.

High-dimensional mRNA data can capture this biological diversity, but its complexity and noise limit robust subtype characterization. Furthermore, current classification approaches often fail to reflect subtype-specific transcriptional programs, underscoring the need for computational strategies that reduce dimensionality and identify discriminative molecular features. Methods: We designed a multi-stage feature selection and network analysis framework tailored for high-dimensional transcriptomic data. Starting with ~65,000 mRNA features, we applied unsupervised variance-based filtering and correlation pruning to eliminate low-information genes and reduce redundancy. The applied supervised Select-K Best filtering further refined the feature space. To enhance robustness, we implemented a hybrid selection strategy combining recursive feature elimination (RFE) with random forests and LASSO regression to identify discriminative mRNA features. Finally, these features were then used to construct a gene co-expression similarity network. Results: This pipeline reduced approximately 65,000 gene features to a subset of 83 discriminative transcripts, which were then used for network construction to reveal subtype-specific biology. The analysis identified four distinct groups. One group exhibited classical high-grade serous features defined by TP53 mutations and homologous recombination deficiency, while another was enriched for PI3K/AKT and ARID1A-associated signaling consistent with clear cell and endometrioid-like biology. A third group displayed drug resistance-associated transcriptional programs with receptor tyrosine kinase activation, and the fourth demonstrated a hybrid profile bridging serous and endometrioid expression modules.

Nephropathic Cystinosis (NC), caused by mutations in the CTNS gene, is characterised by cystine accumulation in lysosomes due to dysfunctional cystinosin, a heavily N-glycosylated lysosomal transporter. We analysed total serum and IgG N-glycosylation using hydrophilic interaction ultra performance liquid chromatography (HILIC-UPLC) to explore the diagnostic biomarker capabilities and their pathophysiological relevance in NC. In this double-blind study (n = 12), we examined N-glycosylation of total serum and serum IgG from Irish participants with and without NC. Dimensionality reduction methods were used applying their glycan data to predict NC status, yet only modest predictive power was observed (66.6% for serum and 50% for IgG N-glycosylation). However, upon unblinding the data, we identified significant differences in specific serum N-glycosylation in NC, particularly in sialylation. These findings provide the first evidence that serum N-glycosylation is altered in NC. These changes may indicate disease-associated systemic alteration including dysregulation in N-glycosylation pathway. It provides justification for the need for a larger validation study and invites further exploration of its role in NC pathophysiology. We provide key recommendations for age stratification for studying serum, plasma and IgG N-glycans in juvenile cohorts as they display unique profiles compared to adult populations, an important consideration for all juvenile studies, even beyond the scope of rare diseases.",IgG glycoprotein | lysosomal storage disease | N-glycosylation | Nephropathic Cystinosis | serum,0,1,all publisherhybridgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Hybrid Gold Green,RRF,R01AR073201,Fundación Bechara

(2) Methods: EEG recordings from 19 scalp channels were analyzed in children with ASD and TD. The three nonlinear metrics were computed for each channel. Group differences were evaluated statistically, while machine learning classifiers assessed discriminative performance. Dimensionality reduction with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was applied to visualize clustering. (3) Results: All metrics showed significant group differences across multiple channels. Machine learning classifiers achieved >90% accuracy, demonstrating robust discriminative power. t-SNE revealed distinct ASD and TD clustering, with nonlinear separability in specific channels. Visual processing–related channels were prominent contributors to both classifier predictions and t-SNE cluster boundaries.

Despite the introduction of various multi-omics integration methods in recent years, existing approaches still have limitations, primarily in their reliance on manual feature selection, restricted applicability, and inability to comprehensively capture both inter-sample and cross-omics interactions. To address these challenges, we propose mmMOI, an end-to-end multi-omics integration framework that incorporates multi-label guided learning and multi-scale attention fusion. mmMOI directly processes raw high-dimensional omics data without requiring manual feature selection, thereby enhancing model interpretability and eliminating biases introduced by feature preselection. First, we introduce a multi-label guided multi-view graph neural network, which enables the model to adaptively learn omics data representations across different datasets, thereby improving generalizability and stability. Second, we design a multi-scale attention fusion network, which integrates global attention and local attention. This dual-attention mechanism allows mmMOI to more accurately integrate multi-omics data, enhance cross-omics feature representations, and improve classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that mmMOI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks, exhibiting high stability and adaptability across diverse biological contexts and sequencing technologies.

The objective of the study is to develop a prognostic indicator for BCR using machine learning (ML) and motor protein-related genes (MPRGs). Methods The prognosis relevance of the MPRGs in prostate cancer was analyzed by univariate Cox regression. Feature selection and model construction were performed using combinations of multiple machine learning algorithms. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and C-index. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the risk signature, and comparisons of BCR incidence, gene expression profiles, immune cell infiltration patterns, and drug sensitivity were conducted between these groups. The gene expression of MPRGs were validated in vitro. Results Among 120 MPRGs, 17 were differentially expressed, of which 8 were significantly associated with BCR. A novel risk scoring system using a StepCox[forward] + Ridge model based on these 8 MPRGs effectively stratified patients into two different risk groups, and patients with high riskscores had significantly higher BCR rates than those with lower riskscores. Enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation response, EMT, hypoxia, and estrogen response pathways in the high-risk category, while mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets were downregulated. The MPRG-derived risk score correlated positively with M2 macrophage infiltration and ngatively correlated with CD4 T cells and mast cells, and the high-risk category showed higher sensitivity to drugs like cisplatin and bicalutamide. The final nomogram based on MPRGs-derived signature and T stage provided an excellent tool for predicting BCR. In vitro experiments further validated that the expression trends of MPRGs in the risk signature were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results. Conclusion This study developed a novel MPRG-derived risk signature that effectively predicts BCR in prostate cancer, offering valuable insights for clinical management and personalized treatment strategies.",,0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

These datasets generally possess many features but relatively few samples, resulting in challenges associated with the “curse of dimensionality”, such as feature redundancy and an elevated risk of overfitting. While traditional feature selection approaches, such as filter-based and wrapper-based approaches, can help to reduce dimensionality, they often struggle to capture feature interactions while adequately preserving model generalization. Therefore, this paper introduces the Adaptive Cluster-Guided Simple, Fast, and Efficient (ACG-SFE) feature selection, a hybrid approach designed to address the challenges of high-dimensional microarray data in binary classification. ACG-SFE enhances the Simple, Fast, and Efficient (SFE) evolutionary feature selection model by integrating hierarchical clustering to dynamically group correlated features based on the optimal number of clusters determined by the Silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin score, and the feature-to-observation ratio while adaptively selecting representative features within clusters using mutual information and adjusting the selection threshold through a progress factor. This hybrid filter-wrapper approach improves feature interactions, effectively minimizing redundancy and overfitting while enhancing classification performance. The proposed model is assessed against four state-of-the-art evolutionary feature selection models on 11 high-dimensional microarray datasets. Experimental results indicate that ACG-SFE effectively selects a small yet pertinent feature subset, minimizing redundancy while attaining enhanced classification accuracy and F-measure. Furthermore, its reduced RMSE between train and test accuracy substantiates its capability to reduce overfitting, outperforming comparative models. These findings establish ACG-SFE as an effective feature selection model for handling high-dimensional microarray data in binary classification, enhancing classification accuracy while selecting minimal relevant features to reduce unnecessary complexity and the risk of overfitting.",,1,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,USM,304/ PKOMP/6315616,Universiti Sains Malaysia

Existing solutions often rely on dimensionality reduction techniques that risk discarding discriminative features, or on deep learning methods that require large-scale training data and suffer from poor interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel discriminative subspace clustering algorithm that avoids traditional dimensionality reduction and instead operates directly in the high-dimensional space. Our method partitions the sample space into multiple local affine hulls and introduces a discriminative geometric distance metric that accounts for both relevant and irrelevant subspaces. Specifically, the model measures the ratio between a query sample's proximity to its class-specific affine hull and its distance from unrelated class subspaces. This dual-space modeling improves both intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. To ensure computational efficiency, we reformulate distance calculations as matrix multiplications and leverage SVD for subspace projection, enabling scalable performance across large datasets. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. It achieves up to 92.60% accuracy on MNIST and maintains high robustness on sparse and noisy data, validating its effectiveness for high-dimensional clustering tasks. This work contributes a geometrically interpretable and computationally efficient framework that closes a long-standing gap in unsupervised learning under high-dimensional constraints.",Affine hull modeling | Discriminative distance metric | Geometric interpretability | High-dimensional data clustering | Subspace clustering,0,1,all publisherfullgold,All Open Access Gold,NNSF,2024A03J0401,Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project

Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional methods.",automated gene selection | biological pathway | disease outcome prediction | multi-agent reinforcement learning,0,1,all publisherfullgold,All Open Access Gold,NAE,2152030,National Academy of Engineering

Although metabolic dysregulation plays a key role in EC pathogenesis, the clinical relevance of lipid droplet–associated genes (LDAGs) remains largely unexplored. This study aims to establish LDAG-based gene signatures with strong diagnostic and prognostic potential in EC. Aims: To identify LDAG signatures with prognostic and diagnostic utility in EC. Methods and Results: A curated set of LDAGs was systematically analyzed across publicly available EC datasets to identify differentially expressed LDAGs (DE-LDAGs). Survival-associated DE-LDAGs were then identified using univariate Cox regression. A four-gene prognostic model was developed through LASSO-based feature selection followed by multivariate Cox regression and validated using Kaplan–Meier survival and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. From the same pool of survival-associated DE-LDAGs, a six-gene diagnostic model was constructed using LASSO, ROC analysis, and logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated using ROC curves and support vector machine (SVM) classification. Functional enrichment and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were conducted to assess the biological relevance of the identified genes. Our results demonstrate that the four-gene prognostic model (LMLN, LMO3, PRKAA2, and RAB10) stratified EC patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (p < 0.05; time-dependent AUC > 0.70). The six-gene diagnostic model (AIFM2, ABCG1, LIPG, DGAT2, LPCAT1, and VCP) demonstrated near-perfect classification of tumor versus normal tissues (AUC ≈0.99 in ROC analysis; 99.8% accuracy in SVM analysis). Functional enrichment linked DE-LDAGs to lipid metabolism, ER stress response, cholesterol homeostasis, and autophagy, underscoring their biological relevance in EC pathobiology.

Gene expression data from 4,224 differentially expressed genes across 74 individuals was analyzed using LASSO, EN, Adaptive LASSO, Group LASSO, SIS, ISIS, SCAD, and SVM. Models were assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R<sup>2</sup> values. SCAD demonstrated the best predictive performance (MSE: 529.00, RMSE: 23.00, R<sup>2:</sup> 0.69), surpassing ISIS (R<sup>2:</sup> 0.61), SIS (R<sup>2:</sup> 0.60), and EN (R<sup>2:</sup> 0.57).

Gene interaction network analysis confirmed their role in RCC progression. Despite SCAD’s strong performance, 31% of variability remained unexplained, underscoring the need for hybrid ML models. Combining deep learning approaches like CNNs with interpretable methods such as SCAD or Elastic Net could improve predictive accuracy and reveal complex gene interactions in RCC prognosis.This research supports SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by advancing precision medicine, early RCC detection, and biomedical data-driven innovations for improved clinical decision-making.",Feature selection | Machine learning | Renal cell carcinoma | Survival data | Ultra-high dimension,0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,USM,,Universiti Sains Malaysia

Endothelial cells play a critical role in COPD pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the effective-component combination of Bufei Yishen formula III (ECC-BYF III) significantly improves clinical symptoms and quality of life in COPD patients. Aim of the study: To identify endothelial cell-associated hub genes in COPD using single-cell analysis and machine learning, and to elucidate the intervention mechanism underlying ECC-BYF III. Materials and methods: Single-cell analysis was used to identify altered cellular subtypes in COPD samples. High-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) and multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to identify COPD-related hub genes. These genes were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, independent datasets, qRT-PCR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a rat model of COPD. Results: Single-cell analysis revealed nine distinct cell subtypes, with endothelial cells markedly reduced in COPD samples compared to controls. Cell communication and pseudotime trajectory analysis highlighted the role and developmental trajectory of endothelial cells in COPD. Differential expression analysis and hdWGCNA identified 269 endothelial cell–associated genes, from which six hub genes were selected via machine learning. qRT-PCR confirmed that CD74, AQP1, SOX4, and ANXA1 were significantly dysregulated in both HUVECs and COPD rat models, consistent with the data analysis results. Notably, ECC-BYF III intervention reversed these gene expression abnormalities. Molecular docking demonstrated that the components of ECC-BYF III exhibited strong binding affinities for the hub genes. Conclusions: Four hub genes (CD74, SOX4, AQP1, and ANXA1) involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial cells in COPD were identified. ECC-BYF III was shown to modulate their expression, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for COPD.

OS patients are mainly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection. This treatment is effective for early osteosarcoma. However, the effect declines as the disease progresses. Currently, our research on osteosarcoma is not enough to meet the clinical needs. Exosomes play a critical role in osteosarcoma progression by mediating intercellular communication. They carry molecular signals, including miRNAs and proteins, which can influence tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. Recent studies have shown that exosomes from osteosarcoma cells can promote cell proliferation and migration, making them potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets in osteosarcoma. This opens up new possibilities for the research of osteosarcoma. The combined genes of exosomes and DEGs were identified by searching GeneCards and GEO databases. Subsequent analyses included GO and KEGG Enrichment, GSEA. The core gene set was derived from the intersection of LASSO and SVM-RFE outputs, ensuring minimal redundancy through dimensionality reduction. Osteosarcoma was diagnosed and predicted by differential expression levels, ROC curve analysis, and nomogram. Immune cell infiltration in osteosarcoma was evaluated by the ssGSEA algorithm. Drug enrichment analysis and molecular docking simulations were conducted to discover the most promising drug leads. In vitro experiments included Wound Healing Assay and qRT-PCR to detect the therapeutic effect of the drug. Through multiple analyses and dimensionality reduction of the data set, six genes were selected (WNT5A, GCA, ANXA6, BIRC5, IL1β, and ARPC3). We examined differential expression in the control and tumor groups and made a gene prediction nomogram. Analysis of immune cell infiltration revealed significant alterations in the composition of immune cell subsets. Drug enrichment analysis and molecular docking of these six core genes were conducted to screen out the most suitable candidate drug: Mifepristone. Finally, Mifepristone was proved to inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis identified six exosome-associated osteosarcoma genes (WNT5A, GCA, ANXA6, BIRC5, IL1β, and ARPC3) that could serve as potential biomarkers.

So far, no reliable electrocardiogram (ECG) biomarkers have been presented for risk assessment, but ECG in HCM patients are often abnormal due to structural and electrical abnormalities. This study aimed to extract morphological ECG biomarkers to differentiate HCM patients based on their arrhythmic risk levels (15 HCM patients with arrhythmic events vs. 40 HCM control). We extracted ECG features including width, amplitudes, slopes between fiducial points, Hermite transform coefficients, and variational mode decomposition features. Following feature selection using combined metrics, the study population was divided into two groups for each ECG biomarker, with the median value serving as the cutoff point to distinguish between the groups. QRS and T waverelated features effectively separated patients into high and low arrhythmic risk categories. Notably, univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients having more local QRS optima or highest percentage of negative QRS present the highest risk (p< 0.01 and p< 0.05 respectively). In conclusion, we proposed automatic ECG extracted features that can be used to stratify the risk for arrhythmic events in HCM patients.Clinical Relevance-This study provides novel insights into ECG-based risk stratification for HCM patients, offering potential tools for early identification of individuals at higher risk of cardiac events.",,0,0,,,,,

Existing DRMs, such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE), optimize different visualization objectives, resulting in trade-offs between cluster separability, spatial organization, and temporal coherence. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GIBOOST, an AI-driven framework that integrates outputs from multiple DRMs using a Bayesian framework and an optimized autoencoder. GIBOOST systematically selects and integrates the two most informative DRMs by evaluating key visualization features, including separability, spatial continuity, uniformity, cellular dynamics, and cluster sensitivity. Rather than prioritizing a single DRM, it identifies the optimal combination that maximizes clustering sensitivity (GI) while preserving biologically relevant spatial and temporal structures. This integration is further refined through a GI-optimized autoencoder, which optimizes the joint distribution of GI, neuron count, and batch size effects to improve visualization quality. We demonstrate GIBOOST’s efficacy across multiple dynamic biological processes, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition, CiPSC reprogramming, spermatogenesis, and placental development. Compared to nine individual DRMs, GIBOOST enhances clustering sensitivity and biological relevance by ∼30%, enabling more accurate interpretation of differentiation trajectories and cell–cell interactions. When applied to a large single-cell RNA-seq dataset (∼400 000 cells, 28 cell types, seven placental regions), GIBOOST uncovers novel immune-placenta interactions, providing deeper insights into cross-tissue communication during pregnancy. By improving both the visualization and interpretability of high-dimensional data, GIBOOST serves as a powerful tool for computational systems biology, enabling a more accurate exploration of complex cellular systems.",AI-driven data integration | cell–cell communication | data visualization | dimensionality reduction | immune-placental interactions | single-cell analysis,0,1,all publisherfullgold,All Open Access Gold,USNIH,2021-240134 (5022,National Institutes of Health

The advanced research is increased for the development of clustering algorithms tailored for single-cell RNA sequencing data. Conventional methods primarily focus on local relationships among cells or genes, while overlooking the global cell-gene interactions. As a result, the high dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of the data continue to pose significant challenges to clustering accuracy. To address the challenges of single-cell clustering analysis, we propose a novel single-cell clustering model, scGGC, which integrates graph autoencoders and generative adversarial network techniques. The innovations of scGGC include two components: (i) construction of an adjacency matrix that incorporates cell-cell and cell-gene relationships to capture complex interactions in a graph structure, enabling nonlinear dimensionality reduction and initial clustering via a graph autoencoder; (ii) enhancement of clustering performance by selecting high-confidence samples from the initial clusters for adversarial neural network training. A comprehensive evaluation on nine publicly available scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scGGC outperforms eight comparison methods. For example, on datasets such as MHC3K, the Adjusted Rand Index increases by an average of 10.1%. Furthermore, marker gene identification and cell type annotation further confirm the biological relevance of scGGC, with marker gene overlap rates exceeding 70% across multiple datasets. We conclude that scGGC not only improves the accuracy of single-cell data clustering but also enhances the identification of cell-type-specific marker genes.",cell-gene interaction | dimensionality reduction | generative adversarial networks | high-confidence cells | scRNA-seq,0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,JJKH20251051KJ,Education Department of Jilin Province

However, the relationship between Treg and the heterogeneity of RCC remains to be explored. Methods: We acquired single-cell RNA-seq profiles and 537 bulk RNA-seq profiles of TCGA-KIRC cohort. Through clustering, monocle2 pseudotime and prognostic analyses, we identified Treg states-related prognostic genes (TSRPGs), then constructing the RCC Treg states-related prognostic classification (RCC-TSC). We also explored its prognostic significance and multi-omics landmarks. Additionally, we utilized correlation analysis to establish regulatory networks, and predicted candidate inhibitors.

Methods: Multi-centre pre-operative MRI acquired between 2014 and 2020 in patients with IDH-wildtype unifocal WHO grade 4 GBM were retrospectively evaluated. WhiteStripe (WS), Nyul histogram matching (HM), and Z-score (ZS) ISTs were applied before radiomic feature (RF) extraction. RFs were realigned using ComBat and minimum batch size (MBS) of 5, 10, or 15 patients. Cox proportional hazards models for overall survival (OS) prediction were produced using five different selection strategies and the impact of IST and MBS was evaluated using bootstrapping. Calibration, discrimination, relative explained variation, and model fit were assessed. Instability was evaluated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), feature selection frequency and calibration curves across the bootstrap resamples. Results: One hundred ninety-five patients were included. Median OS = 13 (95% CI: 12–14) months. Twelve to fourteen unique MRI protocols were used per MRI sequence. HM and WS produced the highest relative increase in model discrimination, explained variation and model fit but IST choice did not greatly impact on stability, nor calibration. Larger ComBat batches improved discrimination, model fit, and explained variation but higher MBS (reduced sample size) reduced stability (across all performance metrics) and reduced calibration accuracy. Conclusion: Heterogenous, real-world GBM data poses a challenge to the reproducibility of radiomics. ComBat generally improved model performance as MBS increased but reduced stability and calibration. HM and WS tended to improve model performance. Key Points: Question ComBat harmonisation of RFs and intensity standardisation of MRI have not been thoroughly evaluated in multicentre, heterogeneous GBM data. Findings The addition of ComBat and ISTs can improve discrimination, relative model fit, and explained variance but degrades the calibration and stability of survival models. Clinical relevance Radiomics risk prediction models in real-world, multicentre contexts could be improved by ComBat and ISTs, however, this degrades calibration and prediction stability and this must be thoroughly investigated before patients can be accurately separated into different risk groups.",Brain neoplasms | Diagnostic imaging | Glioblastoma | Prognosis | Radiomics,0,1,all publisherhybridgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Hybrid Gold Green,CRUK,C19942/A28832,Cancer Research UK

Reliable predictors of early recurrence remain limited. This exploratory study aimed to identify clinical features associated with first tumor recurrence using a machine learning approach tailored to low-event settings. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study of 23 pediatric patients with histologically confirmed sarcoma. Forty-six baseline variables were extracted per patient, including clinical, histological, and comorbidity data. Tumor recurrence was the primary binary endpoint. A LASSO-regularized logistic regression model was developed using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) to identify the most informative predictors. Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and SHAP-value analyses were used to visualize patient clustering and interpret variable contributions. Results: The model identified a four-variable risk signature comprising histological grade, primary tumor width, arterial hypertension, and extremity localization. Each additional tumor grade or centimeter of width approximately doubled the odds of recurrence (OR 2.18 and 2.04, respectively). Hypertension and limb location were associated with a 1.7 and 1.9 odds ratio of recurrence, respectively. The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.61 ± 0.08 and AUROC of 0.47 ± 0.12, reflecting limited discriminative power. PCA mapping revealed distinct outlier patterns correlating with high-risk profiles. Conclusions: Even in a small cohort, classical prognostic markers, such as tumor grade and size, retained predictive relevance, while hypertension emerged as a novel, potentially modifiable cofactor or indicator for recurrence.

Immunotherapies, such as vaccines, necessitate a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment and tumor-specific antigens. The immune heterogeneity of ESCA, which is shaped by immune cell infiltration and antigen presentation, remains largely unexplored, particularly in terms of its interactions with autoimmune mechanisms. This study employs multi-omics analysis to profile the immunophenotype of ESCA, aiming to identify immune evasion mechanisms, tumor antigens, and autoimmune-related pathways. By elucidating these features, we seek to uncover potential targets for vaccine development and personalized immunotherapies, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes. Methods: To screen for potential antigen genes, we examined the overexpressed and mutated genes specific to ESCA. Additionally, we employed Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox analysis to evaluate the prognostic relevance of these potential tumor antigens. To achieve data aggregation and construct a consistency matrix, we used consistency clustering. Subsequently, a graph learning-based dimensionality reduction method was implemented to clarify the immune subtypes. Furthermore, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to cluster potential antigen genes and identify hub genes. Results: Our analysis identified six overexpressed and mutated tumor antigens that were strongly associated with poor prognosis and antigen-presenting cell (APC) infiltration in ESCA. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data consistently identified three immune subtypes. These findings allowed for the construction of the immune landscape of TCGA samples based on the respective immune subtypes. The integration of immunogenomics analysis further allowed for the characterization of the immune microenvironment for each immune subtype. WGCNA successfully screened for three prognostic factors. Conclusions: In our analysis, BTN2A1, MICA, and HHLA2 displayed significant potential as antigens for the development of anti-ESCA messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.

The integration of biology, medicine, statistics, and computer science has become essential for addressing the complexities of cancer biology. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental teaching design aimed at equipping students with the skills to analyze tumor transcriptome data, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhancing critical thinking. The study focuses on liver cancer (LIHC), leveraging publicly available datasets to explore gene expression patterns, identify potential biomarkers, and evaluate their clinical relevance. The goal is to prepare students for the challenges of modern biomedical research by providing hands-on experience with cutting-edge analytical tools and methodologies. [Methods] The experimental teaching design is structured around a series of analytical steps, each targeting a specific aspect of transcriptome analysis. The course is tailored for second- and third-year undergraduate students in biological sciences, biotechnology, and bioinformatics. The primary methods employed include: 1) Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Students are introduced to the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, a comprehensive resource for cancer genomics data. They download RNA-Seq expression data and corresponding clinical information for LIHC and adjacent normal tissues. 2) Differential Expression Analysis: Using the DESeq2 package in R, students perform differential expression analysis to identify genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Visualization tools, such as volcano plots, are used to illustrate the distribution of differentially expressed genes. 3) Functional Enrichment Analysis: The ClusterProfiler package is employed to conduct Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. This step helps students understand the biological processes and pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes, such as cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and metabolic pathways. 4) Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data, allowing students to visualize the separation between tumor and normal samples. This step highlights the heterogeneity of tumor tissues and the utility of dimensionality reduction techniques in data interpretation. 5) Survival Analysis: Students integrate gene expression data with clinical survival information to assess the prognostic value of specific genes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are generated, and log-rank tests are used to compare survival outcomes between groups with high and low expression of selected genes, such as PLVAP. [Results] A total of 9,039 differentially expressed genes were identified, with 7,120 genes upregulated and 1,919 genes downregulated in liver cancer tissues compared to normal tissues. Notably, the PLVAP gene was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues, consistent with its potential role in tumor angiogenesis. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that upregulated genes were predominantly enriched in pathways related to cell cycle regulation and DNA replication, while downregulated genes were associated with metabolic processes such as fatty acid degradation and PPAR signaling. These findings align with the known metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. PCA effectively distinguished between tumor and normal samples. Survival analysis indicated that high expression of PLVAP was associated with better prognosis in liver cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target or prognostic marker. [Conclusions] This experimental teaching design successfully integrates multiple disciplines to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of tumor transcriptome analysis. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical data analysis, students gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and methodologies. The course not only enhances students' technical skills but also fosters critical thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the ability to interpret complex biological data. The findings underscore the importance of transcriptome analysis in uncovering the molecular mechanisms of cancer and identifying potential therapeutic targets. As the field of cancer research continues to advance, this interdisciplinary approach will be invaluable in preparing the next generation of scientists to tackle the challenges of precision medicine and personalized cancer therapy.",differential expression | functional enrichment | principal component analysis (PCA) | survival analysis | transcriptome,0,0,,,,,

It encompasses a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments, ranging from mild to severe stages, each of which demands varying levels of care. Current diagnostic approaches often treat dementia as a uniform condition, potentially overlooking clinically significant subtypes, which limits the effectiveness of treatment and care strategies. This study seeks to address the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to a large, multi-modal dataset of dementia patients (encompassing multiple data sources including clinical, demographic, gene expression and protein concentrations), with the aim of identifying distinct subtypes within the population. The primary focus is on differentiating between mild and severe stages of dementia to improve diagnostic accuracy and personalize treatment plans. Methods: The dataset analyzed included 911 individuals, described by 157 multi-modal characteristics, encompassing clinical, genomic, proteomic and sociodemographic features. After handling missing data, the dataset was reduced to 561 rows and 135 columns. Various dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to improve the feature-to-patient ratio, and unsupervised clustering methods were employed to identify potential subtypes. The major novelty in our methodology regards the combination of different techniques, bridging high-dimensional statistical inference, multi-modal dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, to appropriately model the multi-modal nature of the data and ensure clinical relevance. Results: The analysis revealed distinct clusters within the dementia population, each characterized by specific clinical and demographic profiles. These profiles included variations in biomarkers, cognitive scores, and disability levels. The findings suggest the presence of previously unrecognized subgroups, distinguished by their genomic, proteomic, and clinical characteristics. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that unsupervised machine learning can effectively identify clinically relevant subtypes of dementia, with important implications for diagnosis and personalized treatment.

Despite numerous dimensionality reduction methods developed for scRNA-seq data, many are limited to analyzing individual gene expression matrices and struggle to address false positives and false zero expression entries effectively. Moreover, existing methods often underutilize prior knowledge of similarity and dissimilarity between multi-omics data, leading to the loss of intercellular correlations and shared structural information, thus hindering desired dimensionality reduction outcomes. To address these limitations, a novel model termed joint non-negative matrix factorization with similarity and dissimilarity constraints (SDJNMF) was proposed to tailor for scRNA-seq data clustering. The model leverages prior knowledge of similarity and dissimilarity across multiple gene expression matrices, facilitating joint non-negative matrix factorization to extract common features from multi-omics data. By preserving shared structural and cellular relevance information, SDJNMF enhances the clustering of similar cells while effectively separating dissimilar ones. Furthermore, the SDJNMF model incorporates sparse Singular Value Decomposition during initialization to mitigate noise and redundancy and ensure robust dimensionality reduction. The experimental results demonstrate that the SDJNMF model exhibits superior performance on the 10 datasets, not only outperforming the other 14 algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy on the 9 datasets, but also enhancing the ARI of SDJNMF by an average of 0.0687 in comparison to the second-best algorithm on each dataset. In the visual representation, the model is able to efficiently and accurately cluster similar cells and effectively discriminate different classes of cells from each other. Additionally, the SDJNMF model was applied to identify informative genes and conduct enrichment analysis, validating that genes identified by SDJNMF significantly influence biological processes. Overall, the SDJNMF offers innovative tools for cell cluster identification and advances biological research.

Therefore, it is critical to predict the presence of glycosylation, whether it occurs or not. Currently, predicting glycosylation sites is still done manually using biological methods, which require repeated experiments and a significant amount of time. To address these challenges, it is essential to rapidly develop computational data models using machine learning methods.

This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to dissect fibroblast heterogeneity in CRC. Data processing employed Seurat for quality control, principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding for visualization. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2. Immune infiltration was assessed via Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, CIBERSORT, and xCell algorithms. Prognostic genes were identified through univariate Cox regression, followed by consensus clustering and survival analysis. Metabolic pathways were explored using scMetabolism. Experimental validation involved CCK8, scratch, and Transwell assays to evaluate the roles of key genes BGN and CERCAM in CRC cell proliferation and metastasis. Machine learning-driven analysis identified four fibroblast-associated genes (TRIP6, TIMP1, BGN, and CERCAM) demonstrating significant prognostic relevance in CRC. Consensus clustering based on these biomarkers stratified CRC patients into three distinct molecular subtypes (Clusters A–C). Notably, Cluster C exhibited the most unfavorable clinical outcomes coupled with marked upregulation of all four fibroblast-related genes. Comprehensive immune profiling revealed paradoxical features in Cluster C: heightened global immune activation (characterized by substantial leukocyte infiltration) coexisted with specific immunosuppressive elements, including significant enrichment of pro-tumorigenic M0 macrophages, depletion of anti-tumor plasma cells, and resting memory CD4+ T cells, along with coordinated upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules. Computational prediction using the TIDE platform suggested enhanced immunotherapy responsiveness in Cluster C patients. Functional validation demonstrated that knockdown of BGN or CERCAM significantly impaired malignant phenotypes, reducing proliferative capacity, migration potential, and invasive ability. Fibroblasts demonstrate significant heterogeneity within the CRC immune microenvironment, impacting prognosis and therapeutic responses. Key genes BGN and CERCAM emerge as potential immunotherapeutic targets, offering new strategies for precision treatment of CRC.",colorectal cancer | fibroblasts | immune environment | single cell transcriptome | spatial transcriptome,0,0,,,NSFC,82072750,National Natural Science Foundation of China

High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies facilitate the discovery of data-driven biomarkers through extensive datasets. This study focuses on identifying biomarkers in gene expression data related to chemical injuries by mustard gas, covering a spectrum from healthy individuals to severe injuries. Materials and methods: The study utilized RNA-Seq data comprising 52 expression data samples for 54,583 gene transcripts. These samples were categorized into four classes based on the GOLD classification for chemically injured individuals: Severe (n = 14), Moderate (n = 11), Mild (n = 16), and healthy controls (n = 11). Data preparation involved examining an Excel file created in the R programming environment using MLSeq and devtools packages. Feature selection was performed using Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, with Random Forest algorithm employed for classification. Ab initio methods ensured computational efficiency and result accuracy, while molecular dynamics simulation acted as a virtual experiment bridging the gap between experimental and theoretical experiences. Results: A total of 12 models were created, each introducing a list of differentially expressed genes as potential biomarkers. The performance of models varied across group comparisons, with the Genetic Algorithm generally outperforming Simulated Annealing in most cases. For the Severe vs. Moderate group, GA achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 94.38%, recall of 91.64%, and specificity of 97.10%. The results highlight the effectiveness of GA in most group comparisons, while SA performed better in specific cases involving Moderate and Mild groups. These biomarkers were evaluated against the gene expression data to assess their expression changes between different groups of chemically injured individuals. Four genes were selected based on level expression for further investigation: CXCR1, EIF2B2, RAD51, and RXFP2. The expression levels of these genes were analyzed to determine their differential expression between the groups. Conclusion: This study was designed as a computational effort to identify diagnostic biomarkers in basic biological system research. Our findings proposed a list of discriminative biomarkers capable of distinguishing between different groups of chemically injured individuals. The identification of key genes highlights the potential for biomarkers to serve as indicators of chemical injury severity, warranting further investigation to validate their clinical relevance and utility in diagnosis and treatment.",Biomarkers | Chemical injured | Machine Learning | Mustard Gas | RNA-Seq,5,0,,,,,

However, the absence of a definitive gold standard makes it challenging to evaluate and compare these methods effectively. In this study, we developed a general framework for the comprehensive evaluation of multi-omics clustering algorithms and introduced an innovative metric, the accuracy-weighted average index, which simultaneously considers both clustering performance and clinical relevance. Using this framework, we performed a thorough evaluation and comparison of 11 state-of-the-art multi-omics clustering algorithms, including deep learning-based methods.

However, beyond group-level analyses, the extent to which NREM deficits vary among patients is unclear, as are their relationships to other sources of heterogeneity including clinical factors, aging, cognitive profiles, and medication regimens. Using newly collected high-density sleep EEG data on 103 individuals with SCZ and 68 controls, we first sought to replicate our previously reported group-level differences between patients and controls (original N = 130) during the N2 stage. Then in the combined sample (N = 301 including 175 patients), we characterized patient-to-patient variability. We replicated all group-level mean differences and confirmed the high accuracy of our predictive model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.93 for diagnosis). Compared to controls, patients showed significantly increased between-individual variability across many (26%) sleep metrics. Although multiple clinical and cognitive factors were associated with NREM metrics, collectively they did not account for much of the general increase in patient-to-patient variability. The medication regimen was a greater contributor to variability. Some sleep metrics including fast spindle density showed exaggerated age-related effects in SCZ, and patients exhibited older predicted biological ages based on the sleep EEG; further, among patients, certain medications exacerbated these effects, in particular olanzapine. Collectively, our results point to a spectrum of N2 sleep deficits among SCZ patients that can be measured objectively and at scale, with relevance to both the etiological heterogeneity of SCZ as well as potential iatrogenic effects of antipsychotic medication.",biomarkers | EEG analysis | psychiatric disorders | sleep spindles,3,1,all publisherhybridgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Hybrid Gold Green,BBRF,UG3 MH125273,Brain and Behavior Research Foundation

Effective prediction of treatment responses remains a challenge. In this study, we aimed to develop gene signature-based machine learning models using transcriptomic data from peripheral immune cells to predict treatment outcomes in patients with LBP. Methods: The transcriptomic data of patients with LBP from peripheral immune cells were retrieved from the GEO database. Patients with LBP were recruited, and treatment outcomes were assessed after 3 months. Patients were classified into two groups: those with resolved pain and those with persistent pain. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were identified through bioinformatic analysis. Key genes were selected using five machine learning models, including Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, SVM, and GBM. These key genes were then used to train 45 machine learning models by combining nine different algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Five-fold cross-validation was employed to ensure robust model evaluation and minimize overfitting. In each fold, the dataset was split into training and validation sets, with model performance assessed using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The final model performance was reported as the mean and standard deviation across all five folds, providing a more reliable estimate of the models' ability to predict LBP treatment outcomes using gene expression data from peripheral immune cells. Results: A total of 61 DEGs were identified between patients with resolved and persistent pain. From these genes, 45 machine learning models were constructed using different combinations of feature selection methods and classification algorithms. The Elastic Net with Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 88.7% ± 8.0% (mean ± standard deviation), followed closely by Elastic Net with Linear Discriminant Analysis (88.7% ± 7.5%) and Lasso with Multilayer Perceptron (87.7% ± 6.7%). Overall, 15 models demonstrated robust performance with accuracy > 80%, suggesting the reliability of our machine learning approach in predicting LBP treatment outcomes. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to visualize the contribution of core genes to model performance, highlighting their roles in predicting treatment outcomes. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of using transcriptomic data from peripheral immune cells and machine learning models to predict treatment outcomes in patients with LBP. The identification of key genes and the high accuracy of certain models provide a basis for future personalized treatment strategies in LBP management.

Feature selection (FS) methods aim to reduce the dimension, and feature grouping has emerged as a foundation for FS techniques that seek to detect strong correlations among features and identify irrelevant features. In this work, we propose the Recursive Cluster Elimination with Intra-Cluster Feature Elimination (RCE-IFE) method that utilizes feature grouping and iterates grouping and elimination steps in a supervised context. We assess dimensionality reduction and discriminatory capabilities of RCE-IFE on various high-dimensional datasets from different biological domains. For a set of gene expression, microRNA (miRNA) expression, and methylation datasets, the performance of RCE-IFE is comparatively evaluated with RCE-IFE-SVM (the SVM-adapted version of RCE-IFE) and SVM-RCE. On average, RCE-IFE attains an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 among tested expression datasets with the fewest features and the shortest running time, while RCE-IFE-SVM (the SVM-adapted version of RCE-IFE) and SVM-RCE achieve similar AUCs of 0.84 and 0.83, respectively. RCE-IFE and SVM-RCE yield AUCs of 0.79 and 0.68, respectively when averaged over seven different metagenomics datasets, with RCE-IFE significantly reducing feature subsets. Furthermore, RCE-IFE surpasses several state-of-the-art FS methods, such as Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF), Information Gain (IG), Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), SelectKBest (SKB), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), obtaining an average AUC of 0.76 on five gene expression datasets. Compared with a similar tool, Multi-stage, RCE-IFE gives a similar average accuracy rate of 89.27% using fewer features on four cancer-related datasets. The comparability of RCE-IFE is also verified with other biological domain knowledge-based Grouping-Scoring-Modeling (G-S-M) tools, including mirGediNET, 3Mint, and miRcorrNet. Additionally, the biological relevance of the selected features by RCE-IFE is evaluated. The proposed method also exhibits high consistency in terms of the selected features across multiple runs.

Because non-significant, low-degree stenoses may still cause strokes, refined risk stratification is necessary, which could be improved by assessing biological features of plaque instability. To challenge risk-stratification based on luminal narrowing, we compared biological features of carotid plaques from symptomatic patients with low-degree (<50%) vs high-degree (>70%) stenosis and explored potential mechanisms behind plaque instability in low-degree stenoses. Methods: Endarterectomy specimens were taken from symptomatic patients with high-degree (n = 204) and low-degree (n = 34) stenosis, all part of the Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies. Patient demographics, image-derived plaque morphology, and gene expression analyses of extracted lesions were used for comparisons. Plaque biology was assessed by transcriptomics using dimensionality reduction, differential gene expression, and gene-set enrichment analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to study proteins corresponding to upregulated genes. Results: The demographics of the two groups were statistically similar. Calcification, lipid-rich necrotic core, intraplaque hemorrhage, plaque burden, and fibrous cap thickness were similar in both groups, whereas the sum of lipid-rich necrotic core and intraplaque hemorrhage was higher (P = .033) in the high-degree stenosis group. Dimensionality reduction analysis indicated poor clustering separation of plaque gene expression in low-compared with high-degree stenosis lesions, whereas differential gene expression showed upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 3A (log<inf>2</inf> fold change, 0.7212; P = .0003), and gene-set enrichment analyses identified pathways related to tissue hypoxia and angiogenesis in low-degree stenoses. Hypoxia-inducible factor 3-alpha protein was associated with smooth muscle cells in neo-vascularized plaque regions. Conclusions: Plaques from symptomatic patients with non-significant low-degree carotid stenoses showed morphologic and biological features of atherosclerotic plaque instability that were comparable to plaques from patients with high-degree stenoses, emphasizing the need for improved stroke risk stratification for intervention in all patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis irrespective of luminal narrowing. An increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 3A in low-degree stenotic lesions suggested mechanisms of plaque instability associated with tissue hypoxia and plaque angiogenesis, but the exact role of hypoxia-inducible factor 3A in this process remains to be determined. Clinical relevance: Carotid plaques from symptomatic patients with <50% stenosis show morphologic and biological features of plaque instability, comparable to high-degree stenosis, which emphasizes the need for improved stroke risk stratification beyond stenosis severity.",Atherosclerotic plaque instability | Degree of stenosis | Hypoxia | Stroke risk | Symptomatic carotid stenosis,1,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,KI,2017-01070,Karolinska Institutet

However, the vast majority of gait analysis in animals has been limited to univariate analysis even though gait data is highly multidimensional. As a result, little is known about how various spatiotemporal components of the gait relate to each other in the context of peripheral nerve injury and trauma. We hypothesize that a multivariate characterization of gait will reveal relationships among spatiotemporal components of gait with biological relevance to peripheral nerve injury and trauma. We further hypothesize that legitimate relationships among said components will allow for more accurate classification among distinct gait phenotypes than if attempted with univariate analysis alone. Methods DigiGait data was collected of mice across groups representing increasing degrees of damage to the neuromusculoskeletal sequence of gait; that is (a) healthy controls, (b) nerve damage only via total nerve transection + reconnection of the femoral and sciatic nerves, and (c) nerve, muscle, and bone damage via total hind-limb transplantation. Multivariate relationships among the 30+ spatiotemporal measures were evaluated using exploratory factor analysis and forward feature selection to identify the features and latent factors that best described gait phenotypes. The identified features were then used to train classifier models and compared to a model trained with features identified using only univariate analysis. Results 10-15 features relevant to describing gait in the context of increasing degrees of traumatic peripheral nerve injury were identified. Factor analysis uncovered relationships among the identified features and enabled the extrapolation of a set of latent factors that further described the distinct gait phenotypes. The latent factors tied to biological differences among the groups (e.g. alterations to the anatomical configuration of the limb due to transplantation or aberrant fine motor function due to peripheral nerve injury). Models trained using the identified features generated values that could be used to distinguish among pathophysiological states with high statistical significance (p < .001) and accuracy (>80%) as compared to univariate analysis alone. Conclusion This is the first performance evaluation of a multivariate approach to gait analysis and the first demonstration of superior performance as compared to univariate gait analysis in animals.

Various strategies have been proposed to address this issue, with a strong emphasis on utilizing gene expression data to enhance cancer detection methods. However, challenges arise due to the high dimensionality, limited sample size relative to its dimensions, and the inherent redundancy and noise in many genes. Consequently, it is advisable to employ a subset of genes rather than the entire set for classifying gene expression data. This research introduces a model that incorporates Ranked-based Filter (RF) techniques for extracting significant features and employs Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for data classification. The computational cost of using RF technique over high dimensional data is low. However extraction of significant genes using one or two stage of reduction is not effective. Thus, a 4-stage feature reduction strategy is applied. The reduced data is then utilized for classification using few variants of ELM model and activation function. Subsequently, a two-stage grading approach is implemented to determine the most suitable classifier for data classification. This analysis is conducted over four microarray gene expression data using four activation function with seven learning based classifiers, from which it is shown that II-ELM classifier outperforms in terms of performance matrix and ROC graph.",Classification | Extreme learning machine | Gene expression data | Grading approach | Ranked based feature selection,2,0,,,,,

To investigate this, we conducted metabolomics on brain tissue from poisoned rats, combined with clinical biochemical and pathological analyses. In the high-dose group, 24 metabolites showed significant differences compared to the control group: 18 were upregulated, including cytosine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, indole, 3-dehydroshikimate, etc.; 6 were downregulated, including 6-phosphogluconic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, dAMP, etc. In the low-dose group, 10 metabolites showed significant differences: 4 were upregulated, including pentamidine, γ-tocotrienol, benzoylecgonine, etc.; and 6 were downregulated, including dAMP, glutathione, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, etc. Enrichment analysis identified two key pathways—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway—as involved in brain injury. ROC analysis of six differential metabolites showed that sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, (2R)-2-hydroxy-3-(phosphonatooxy)propanoate, and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid had AUC values above 0.8. These findings suggest that these three metabolites demonstrate strong diagnostic potential for brain injury induced by diquat poisoning. Correlation analysis linked these biomarkers to clinical indicators such as neutrophil count and the eutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, supporting their relevance.

Our study aims to develop a prognostic model integrating CAFs-related features, with the goal of providing new insights for precise stratification and optimized treatment strategies for GBM patients. Methods: Utilizing GBM-related data from reputable public databases, we utilized the Seurat package in R to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for the characterization of CAFs in GBM. We identified CAFs phenotypes and screened for key CAFs-related genes significantly associated with patient prognosis. Using regression analysis, we constructed a CAFs-based risk score, which was subsequently validated in multiple independent cohorts. A nomogram integrating the risk score and clinicopathological features was also developed. Furthermore, we systematically evaluated the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of the model in GBM patients through multi-dimensional analyses, including gene mutation profiling, pathway enrichment analysis, immune infiltration, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity analysis. Results: A total of six CAFs-related genes (FAM241B, LSM2, IGFBP2, LOXL1, OSMR, and STOX1) were identified as significantly associated with GBM prognosis. We used it to construct the CAFs-based risk score model, which demonstrated robust prognostic performance across multiple cohorts and served as an independent predictor of overall survival in GBM patients, efficiently categorizing groups into high and low risk. By integrating clinical features, the nomogram model significantly increased predictive accuracy and reliability. Analytical results indicated a statistically significant association between the computed risk score and the level of immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, the established prognostic model exhibited robust efficacy in predicting patient outcomes following conventional targeted treatments as well as immunotherapeutic interventions. Conclusions: This study introduces a GBM risk profiling framework and accompanying nomogram, offering exceptional accuracy in prognostic prediction for GBM. The framework and nomogram provide valuable insights into the roles of CAFs and key genes in GBM progression and immunity, and extend beyond classification by offering promising avenues for deciphering tumor mutations, mapping immune landscapes, refining drug predictions, and forecasting the efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions.

High-dimensional genomic data were preprocessed using k-mer encoding and subsequently reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), enabling improved visualization and interpretability. Clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN were then applied to detect inherent groupings within the genome sequences. The results revealed distinct clusters associated with dominant mutations, such as D614G, P681H, and N501Y, primarily affecting the Spike protein and other structural regions. Notably, strong intra-cluster similarities were observed between sequences from Spain and Italy, suggesting shared evolutionary origins and transmission links, while certain USA sequences showed overlap with European variants. Comparative analyses highlighted the biological relevance of these mutations in increased infectivity and immune evasion.

Recent studies suggest that the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) body constitution, particularly the Yang-Deficiency Constitution (YDC), may influence tumour development by altering the immune microenvironment. However, the mechanistic connection between YDC and ccRCC prognosis remains largely unexplored. Objective: This study aims to elucidate the impact of YDC on the immune landscape and clinical outcomes of ccRCC and to identify novel prognostic biomarkers and potential herbal therapeutic agents guided by YDC characteristics. Methods: We integrated bulk transcriptomic data from 12 YDC-classified individuals and 530 ccRCC patients, alongside single-cell RNA-seq profiles from one PBMC and two ccRCC tumour samples. Through differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and machine learning-based survival modelling, we identified YDC-related biomarkers and assessed their immunological relevance using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and CellChat. A gene expression-based scoring framework (GSVA) was developed to systematically prioritize 622 herbal ingredient perturbations for their potential survival benefits. Key ingredients were further validated through molecular docking and experimental assays. Results: Patients with YDC-associated ccRCC exhibited poorer survival. Nine intersecting genes were screened and used to construct a prognostic model, whereby seven key biomarkers—MXD3, PLCB2, CCDC88B, DEF6, IFNG, TBC1D10C, and PLEKHN1—were significantly influenced the prognosis of renal cancer. These genes were found to modulate immune cell populations, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Tregs, and M1 macrophages, with IFNG serving as a central regulatory hub. Baicalein was identified and validated as a promising therapeutic agent targeting IFNG. Conclusion: This study highlights the crucial role of YDC in shaping the immune microenvironment and influencing survival in ccRCC. By integrating constitution-based stratification, immune profiling, and herbal medicine screening, we offer a unique framework for biomarker discovery and propose baicalein as a potential YDC-targeted adjuvant therapy.",clear cell real cell carcinoma (ccRCC) | immuneinfiltration | pre-diagnosis biomarkers | therapeutic intervention | tumor immune microenvironment | Yang-deficiencyconstitution (YDC),0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

This study evaluates the predictive utility of CTI for TVD. Methods: This single-center retrospective study compared clinical characteristics, laboratory indices, and inflammation- and metabolism-related markers between TVD and non-TVD groups. Feature selection using the Boruta algorithm and LASSO regression identified key predictors for constructing a TVD risk model. SHAP analysis provided model interpretability and evaluated the relative importance of predictive factors. Predefined subgroup analyses by sex and diabetes status were conducted using multivariable logistic regression, with interaction terms tested to assess the consistency of CTI’s predictive effect across subgroups. Results: Traditional risk factors, including gender, age, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, were significantly more prevalent in the TVD group. The CTI index was markedly elevated in this group and emerged as a critical predictor. Boruta and LASSO identified CTI, age, and gender as primary predictors. SHAP analysis confirmed the prominent role of CTI, with age and gender also contributing significantly to risk prediction. CTI demonstrated the strongest positive impact on TVD risk assessment. Subgroup analyses showed CTI was significantly associated with TVD in men and diabetic patients, with no significant interaction by sex or diabetes, indicating a generally stable predictive effect. Conclusion: CTI is a reliable predictor of TVD with immediate value for improving current risk assessment and patient stratification.

Conventional 2D cultures capture therapy resistance only to a limited extent, whereas 3D cultures may better reflect relevant conditions. Methods: We established 3D PANC-1 tissue models based on a decellularized porcine jejunum with niche-specific drug response to gemcitabine (GEM) treatment. TGFB1 induced invasion and further drug resistance. Thus, we performed scRNA-seq after treatment with GEM, TGFB1 stimulation, or both. Data were analyzed using standard approaches and a novel mutual-information-based machine learning framework (gSELECT). Candidate genes were further evaluated through enrichment and survival analyses. Additionally, we present a novel mathematical approach as proof of concept for analyzing differences in gene expression between groups seemingly similar with respect to a projection such as t-SNE or UMAP (e.g., GEM-treated and untreated cells). For this, we stratified control cells by similarity to GEM-treated survivors, yielding predicted-resistant and predicted-sensitive subgroups for downstream analysis. Results: Pre-analysis using machine learning and comparative analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data showed only minor differences in gene expression in response to GEM treatment, whereas TGFB1 induced an invasive phenotype characterized by EMT-related transcriptional changes, including downregulation of cytokeratins. Laboratory experiments showed that ∼75 % of PANC-1 cells survived GEM in 3D, indicating intrinsic resistance. Our mathematical approach using machine learning predicted a GEM-sensitive subpopulation consistent with these findings. Comparative analyses revealed mutual information (MI) genes distinguishing sensitive from resistant cells, several of which were supported by literature and survival data. Conclusion: Computational analysis of scRNA-seq data from 3D-cultured PANC-1 cells provides a useful framework for studying treatment effects.

The present study aimed to establish radiomics-based models to predict the CTLA4 expression level in patients with breast cancer (BRCA). Methods: Clinical, transcription, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Cancer Imaging Archive databases. Then, the relationship between the expression level of CTLA4 and survival prognosis was explored using differential analysis, survival analysis, multivariate and univariate Cox analysis, difference analysis of immune cell infiltration degree, and enrichment analysis. Afterwards, radiomics-based prediction models for the CTLA4 expression were constructed through feature extraction via the PyRadiomics package, feature selection via the maximum-relevance minimum-redundancy recursive feature elimination algorithm, and model construction via the support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) classifiers. Results: The patients were classified into two groups based on the optimal cut-off value for the CTLA4 level: low-expression and high-expression groups. The CTLA4 expression level, as an independent predictor for overall survival (OS), was associated with T cell infiltration (P < 0.001), and was mainly correlated to transcriptional signal activation, the cell cycle and apoptosis in the enrichment analysis. A total of 107 radiomics features were extracted, and five features were selected with importance for model construction. The SVM-based model indicated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.701 and 0.688 for the training and testing cohorts, respectively, while the LR-based model indicated an AUC of 0.0.834 and 0.738 for the training and testing cohorts, respectively. Breast cancer tissues were recruited to immunohistochemical verification for CTLA4 expression. Conclusion: The radiomics-based models constructed on enhanced MRI data to predict the CTLA4 expression exhibited good performance in BRCA patients. These may be employed to instruct individualized immunotherapy before surgery.",Breast cancer | CTLA4 | Machine learning | MRI | Prediction model | Prognostic analysis | Radiomics,1,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

To address this challenge, this study introduces the Magnitude-Altitude Score Analysis for Tracking Infection and Time-Dependent Genes (MASIT), a novel method adept at filtering out irrelevant features/genes while focusing on important ones. Methods: Applied to the 3D airway organ tissue equivalent model that mimics human airway physiology, MASIT employed both RNA-Seq and NanoString technologies for a comprehensive analysis. RNA-Seq offered a transcriptomic overview of 19,671 protein coding genes, whereas NanoString targeted 773 specific genes. We used MASIT to analyze gene expression changes in the airway tissue equivalent after exposure to Influenza A virus, Human metapneumovirus, and Parainfluenza virus type 3 at 24- and 72-hour post-infection. MASIT was trained and validated on NanoString data, tested on the held-out RNA-Seq test set, and benchmarked against widely used feature selection approaches, including Fisher score, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance, embedded Lasso regression, and Boruta feature importance. Results: MASIT achieved a 92% accuracy in differentiating eight groups of infected samples. Our findings showed that MASIT outperformed models using the full gene set, notably in algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. Selected genes such as IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, OASL, IFI44, and OAS3 were particularly effective in categorizing samples by viral type and infection stage. Benchmarking further demonstrated that MASIT not only exceeded the performance of existing feature selection methods within NanoString data but also uniquely maintained high accuracy and stability when applied to held-out RNA-Seq data. Discussion: These results provide insights into the host’s molecular response to viral infections and highlight MASIT as a robust tool for analyzing high-dimensional, small-sample multi-omics datasets.",3D airway organ tissue equivalent (OTEs) | differential expression analysis | NanoString technologies | predictive modeling | RNA-Seq data | viral infection,0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,W15QKN-16-9-1002,

Meanwhile, functional connectivity networks (FCNs) generate high-dimensional connectomes, making it difficult to accurately capture instantaneous abnormal biomarkers of neurological disorders. To address this issue, we propose a framework, called Brain-Shapelet, to extract discriminative subsequences (Shapelets) from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for capturing instantaneous abnormalities in brain activity. It applies random walk algorithm on group-representative brain network to obtain brain region sets, and aggregates their blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals to extract Shapelets that reflect the associations between different brain regions at the same time point. Specially, we develop a feature selection strategy to reduce redundancy in Shapelets and optimize classification performance. Brain-Shapelet places greater emphasis on short-term brain activity alterations, allowing it to capture instantaneous abnormalities more effectively. It is evaluated on the ABIDE dataset and achieves a classification accuracy of 82.8%, significantly outperforming traditional brain network modeling methods. The proposed co-occurrence rate, occurrence frequency, and Gini coefficient metrics quantify the contributions of brain regions from the perspective of Shapelets, offering valuable insights for ASD diagnosis.",autism spectrum disorder | Brain-Shapelet | functional magnetic resonance imaging | instantaneous abnormalities | Shapelet extraction,2,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NNSF,51877013,Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China

Although random forest (RF) represents a flexible non-parametric approach with several advantages, it can provide poor accuracy in high-dimensional settings, mainly in scenarios with small sample sizes. We propose a knowledge-slanted RF that integrates biological networks as prior knowledge into the model to improve its performance and explainability, exemplifying its use for selecting and identifying relevant genes. knowledge-slanted RF is a combination of two stages. First, prior knowledge represented by graphs is translated by running a random walk with restart algorithm to determine the relevance of each gene based on its connection and localization on a protein-protein interaction network. Then, each relevance is used to modify the selection probability to draw a gene as a candidate split-feature in the conventional RF. Experiments in simulated datasets with very small sample sizes (n≤30) comparing knowledge-slanted RF against conventional RF and logistic lasso regression, suggest an improved precision in outcome prediction compared to the other methods. The knowledge-slanted RF was completed with the introduction of a modified version of the Boruta feature selection algorithm. Finally, knowledge-slanted RF identified more relevant biological genes, offering a higher level of explainability for users than conventional RF.

The integration of scRNA-seq data with multiomics data relevant to BD was accomplished using the single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS) algorithm. We have identified a novel brain cell cluster named ADCY1, which exhibits distinct genetic characteristics. From a high-resolution genetic perspective, glial cells emerge as the primary cytopathology associated with BD. Specifically, astrocytes were significantly related to BD at the RNA-seq level, while microglia showed a strong association with BD across multiple panels, including the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq. Additionally, oligodendrocyte precursor cells displayed a significant association with BD in both ATAC-seq and RNA-seq panel. Notably, our investigation of brain regions affected by BD revealed significant associations between BD and all three types of glial cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Through comprehensive analyses, we identified several BD-associated genes, including CRMP1, SYT4, UCHL1, and ZBTB18.

Machine learning has shown great potential in the prompt prediction of asthma. However, because of the inherent complexity of asthma-related patterns, current models often fail to capture the correlation between data samples, limiting their accuracy. Our objective was to use our novel model to address the above problem via an Affinity Graph Enhanced Classifier (AGEC) to improve predictive accuracy. Methods: The clinical dataset used in this study consisted of 152 samples, where 24 routine blood markers were extracted as features to participate in the classification due to their ease of sourcing and relevance to asthma. Specifically, our model begins by constructing a projection matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving the most discriminative features. Simultaneously, an affinity graph is learned through the resulting subspace to capture the internal relationship between samples better. Leveraging domain knowledge from the affinity graph, a new classifier (AGEC) is introduced for asthma prediction. AGEC’s performance was compared with five state-of-the-art predictive models. Results: Experimental findings reveal the superior predictive capabilities of AGEC in asthma prediction. AGEC achieved an accuracy of 72.50%, surpassing FWAdaBoost (61.02%), MLFE (60.98%), SVR (64.01%), SVM (69.80%) and ERM (68.40%). These results provide evidence that capturing the correlation between samples can enhance the accuracy of asthma prediction. Moreover, the obtained p values also suggest that the differences between our model and other models are statistically significant, and the effect of our model does not exist by chance. Conclusion: As observed from the experimental results, advanced statistical machine learning approaches such as AGEC can enable accurate diagnosis of asthma.

Results: The study included 443 clinical samples and 327 pathological images. Prognostic analysis showed significantly higher TIGIT expression in tumor tissues (P<0.001), with TIGIT being a protective factor for overall survival (OS) in LUAD [hazard ratio (HR) =0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44–0.95; P=0.03]. GSEA revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways. From 465 pathological features, the four best features were selected to construct a pathomics model with good predictive performance. Higher PS values were observed in the TIGIT high-expression group, correlating with improved OS (P=0.009). PS was positively correlated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition related (EMT-related) genes (WIPF1, GLIPR1, IL15) and immune checkpoints (ICOS, CTLA4, LAG3) (P<0.001). Increased abundance of G2/M checkpoint-related genes (MARCKS, CASP8AP2) and infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and M2 macrophages were noted in the high PS group (P<0.05). Conclusions: TIGIT expression is significantly correlated with LUAD prognosis and can effectively predict patient outcomes.",lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) | mechanisms of pathology | pathomics | prognostic model | T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT),0,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

It plays an essential role in facilitating tissue repair by eliminating pathogenic microorganisms. Currently, numerous therapies are applied to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, these conventional anti-inflammatory medications are often labor-intensive, costly, and associated with adverse side effects. Recently, researchers have identified anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) as a cost-effective alternative for treating several inflammatory diseases, due to their high selectivity for target cells with minimal side effects. In this study, we introduce a novel computational predictor, AIPs-DeepEnC-GA, developed to accurately predict AIP samples. The training sequences are encoded using a novel n-spaced dipeptide-based position-specific scoring matrix (NsDP-PSSM) and Pseudo position-specific scoring matrix (PsePSSM)-based embedded evolutionary features. Additionally, the reduced-amino acid alphabet (RAAA-11), and composite Physiochemical properties (CPP) are employed to capture cluster-physiochemical properties based on structural information. A hybrid feature strategy is then applied, integrating embedded evolutionary features, CPP and RAAA-11 descriptors to overcome the limitations of individual encoding methods. Minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) is utilized to select the optimal features. The selected features are trained using four different deep-learning models. The predictive labels generated by these models are provided to a genetic algorithm to form a deep-ensemble training model. The proposed AIPs-DeepEnC-GA model achieved a ∼15 % increase in predictive accuracy, reaching 94.39 %, and a 19 % improvement in the area under the curve (AUC), achieving a value of 0.98 using training sequences. For independent datasets, our method obtained improved accuracies of 91.87 %, and 89.21 %, with AUC values of 0.94 and 0.92 for Ind-I, and Ind-II, respectively. Our proposed AIPs-DeepEnC-GA model demonstrates an 11 % improvement in predictive accuracy over existing AIPs computational models using training samples. The efficacy and reliability of this model make it a promising tool for both in drug development and research academia.",Anti-inflammatory peptides | Deep ensemble model | Evolutionary embedding | Feature selection | Genetic algorithm | Prediction,40,0,,,NSFC,62131004,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Our study utilised AMR gene, pangenomic, and predicted plasmid features from 647 Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis genomes across the One Health continuum, along with corresponding resistance phenotypes, to develop interpretive ML classifiers. Vancomycin resistance could be predicted with 99% accuracy with AMR gene features, 98% with pangenome features, and 96% with plasmid clusters. Top pangenome features overlapped with the resistance genes of the vanA operon, which are often laterally transmitted via plasmids. Doxycycline resistance prediction achieved approximately 92% accuracy with pangenome features, with the top feature being elements of Tn916 conjugative transposon, a tet(M) carrier. Erythromycin resistance prediction models achieved about 90% accuracy, but top features were negatively correlated with resistance due to the confounding effect of population structure.

However, existing feature selection methods often fall short in capturing the local structural characteristics among samples and effectively eliminating redundant features, resulting in inadequate performance in disorder prediction. To address this gap, we propose a novel supervised method named local-structure-preservation and redundancy-removal-based feature selection (LRFS), and then apply it to the identification of meaningful biomarkers for schizophrenia (SZ). LRFS method leverages graph-based regularization to preserve original sample similarity relationships during data transformation, thus retaining crucial local structure information. Additionally, it introduces redundancy-removal regularization based on interrelationships among features to exclude similar and redundant features from high-dimensional data. Moreover, LRFS method incorporates l<inf>2,1</inf> sparse regularization that enables selecting a sparse and noise-robust feature subset. Experimental evaluations on eight public datasets with diverse properties demonstrate the superior performance of our method over nine popular feature selection methods in identifying discriminative features, with average classification accuracy gains ranging from 1.30 % to 9.11 %. Furthermore, the LRFS method demonstrates superior discriminability in four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets from 708 healthy controls (HCs) and 537 SZ patients, with an average increase in classification accuracy ranging from 1.89 % to 9.24 % compared to other nine methods. Notably, our method reveals reproducible and significant changes in SZ patients relative to HCs across the four datasets, predominantly in the thalamus-related functional network connectivity, which exhibit a significant correlation with clinical symptoms. Convergence analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis, and ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. In short, our proposed feature selection method effectively identifies discriminative and reliable features that hold the potential to be biomarkers, paving the way for the elucidation of brain abnormalities and the advancement of precise diagnosis of mental disorders.",Classification | Mental disorder | Neuroimaging | Redundancy | Regularization | Similarity,2,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NIH,1U24RR025736-01,National Institutes of Health

Background: The role of rare cells in TME is less studied. In Silico transcriptomic analyses of real-world data enable us to detect and quantify rare cells, including CMP cells. Methods: A total of 5176 breast cancer (BC) patients from SCAN-B, METABRIC, and 5 single-cell sequence cohorts were analyzed using the xCell algorithm. The high group was defined as more than two-thirds of the CMP scores in each cohort. Results: CMP cells consist of 0.07% to 0.25% of bulk breast tumor cells, more in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) compared with triple-negative (TN) subtype (0.1% to 0.75%, 0.18% to 0.33% of immune cells, respectively). CMP cells did not correlate with any of the myeloid lineages or stem cells in TME. CMP infiltration was higher in smaller tumors, with lower Nottingham grade, and in ER+/HER2- than in TNBC consistently in both SCAN-B and METABRIC cohorts. High CMP was significantly associated with a lower risk of brain metastasis and with better survival, particularly in ER+/HER2-. High CMP enriched epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis pathways, and less cell proliferation and DNA repair gene sets. High CMP ER+/HER2- was associated with less immune cell infiltration and cytolytic activity (P<0.001). CMP infiltration correlated with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy response for both ER+/HER2- and TNBC in the ISPY-2 cohort (AUC=0.69 and 0.74, respectively). Conclusions: CMP in BC is inversely associated with cell proliferation and brain metastasis, better response to immunotherapy, and survival.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) wield a pivotal immunomodulatory influence within the tumor microenvironment, yet their impact on melanoma prognosis and direct molecular interactions with melanoma cells remain elusive. This investigation employs single-cell analysis to unveil the intricate nature of Tregs in human melanoma. Methods: Single-cell RNA and bulk sequencing data, alongside clinical information, were obtained from public repositories. Initially, GO and GSEA analyses were employed to delineate functional disparities among distinct cell subsets. Pseudotime and cell–cell interconnection analyses were conducted, followed by an endeavor to construct a prognostic model grounded in Treg-associated risk scores. This model's efficacy was demonstrated via PCA and K-M analyses, with multivariate Cox regression affirming its independent prognostic value in melanoma patients. Furthermore, immune infiltration analysis, immune checkpoint gene expression scrutiny, and drug sensitivity assessments were performed to ascertain the clinical relevance of this prognostic model. Results: Following batch effect correction, 80 025 cells partitioned into 31 clusters, encompassing B cells, plasma cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, melanoma cells, monocytes, macrophages, and T_NK cells. Within these, 4240 CD4+ T cells were subclassified into seven distinct types. Functional analysis underscored the immunomodulatory function of Tregs within the melanoma tumor microenvironment, elucidating disparities among Treg subpopulations. Notably, the ITGB2 signaling pathway emerged as a plausible molecular nexus linking Tregs to melanoma cells.

This process is linked to diseases such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Traditional wet lab experiments are time-consuming, whereas machine learning has significantly streamlined the prediction of protein glycation sites. Despite promising results, challenges remain, including data imbalance, feature redundancy, and suboptimal classifier performance. This research introduces Glypred, a lysine glycation site prediction model combining ClusterCentroids Undersampling (CCU), LightGBM, and bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) methodologies, with an additional multihead attention mechanism integrated into the BiLSTM. To achieve this, the study undertakes several key steps: selecting diverse feature types to capture comprehensive protein information, employing a cluster-based undersampling strategy to balance the data set, using LightGBM for feature selection to enhance model performance, and implementing a bidirectional LSTM network for accurate classification. Together, these approaches ensure that Glypred effectively identifies glycation sites with high accuracy and robustness. For feature encoding, five distinct feature types─AAC, KMER, DR, PWAA, and EBGW─were selected to capture a broad spectrum of protein sequence and biological information. These encoded features were integrated and validated to ensure comprehensive protein information acquisition. To address the issue of highly imbalanced positive and negative samples, various undersampling algorithms, including random undersampling, NearMiss, edited nearest neighbor rule, and CCU, were evaluated. CCU was ultimately chosen to remove redundant nonglycated training data, establishing a balanced data set that enhances the model’s accuracy and robustness. For feature selection, the LightGBM ensemble learning algorithm was employed to reduce feature dimensionality by identifying the most significant features. This approach accelerates model training, enhances generalization capabilities, and ensures good transferability of the model. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network was used as the classifier, with a network structure designed to capture glycation modification site features from both forward and backward directions. To prevent overfitting, appropriate regularization parameters and dropout rates were introduced, achieving efficient classification. Experimental results show that Glypred achieved optimal performance. This model provides new insights for bioinformatics and encourages the application of similar strategies in other fields.

We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study.

Cancer datasets typically contain numerous gene expression levels as features but with a limited number of samples. Thus, feature selection is a crucial initial step to streamline prediction algorithms. These selected features, or genes, play a pivotal role in cancer identification, treatment selection, and variation analysis among different techniques. To address this challenge, present two novel methodologies, by combining Cuckoo Search (CS) and Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO), referred to as SMOCS (Cuckoo Search followed by Spider Monkey Optimization) and CSSMO (Spider Monkey Optimization followed by Cuckoo Search). These approaches are designed for harnessing the strengths of both metaheuristic algorithms to identify a subset of genes that aid in early-stage cancer prediction. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy of the both algorithms, we employ a gene expression reduction method known as minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) to reduce redundancy in cancer datasets. Subsequently, these gene subsets are classified using Deep Learning (DL) to identify distinct groups or classes associated with specific cancer types. We evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches using six different cancer datasets, assessing cancer sample classification and prediction through metrics such as Recall, Precision, F1-Score, and confusion matrix analysis.

Methods: This study included a total of 222 PD patients with normal baseline cognition, of whom 68 had cognitive impairment during a 4-year follow-up period. All patients underwent MRI scans, and radiomic features were extracted from the whole-brain MRI images of the training set, and dimensionality reduction was performed to construct a radiomics model. Subsequently, Screening predictive factors for cognitive decline from clinical features and then combining those with a radiomics model to construct a multimodal combinatorial model for predicting cognitive decline in PD patients. Evaluate the performance of the comprehensive model using the receiver-operating characteristic curve, confusion matrix, F1 score, and survival curve. In addition, the quantitative characteristics of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from corpus callosum were selected from 52 PD patients to further validate the clinical efficacy of the model. Results: The multimodal combinatorial model has good classification performance, with areas under the curve of 0.842, 0.829, and 0.860 in the training, test, and validation sets, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the number of cognitive decline PD patients and corpus callosum-related DTI parameters between the low-risk and high-risk groups distinguished by the model (p < 0.05). The survival curve analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the progression time of mild cognitive impairment between the low-risk and the high-risk groups.

Here, we propose Graphical Ensembling (GE), a graph-theory-based ensemble feature selection technique designed to improve the stability and relevance of the selected features. Results: Relying on four datasets, we show that GE increases classification performance with fewer selected features. For example, on rheumatoid arthritis patient stratification, GE outperforms the baseline methods by 9% Balanced Accuracy while relying on fewer features. We use data on sub-cellular networks to show that the selected features (proteins) are closer to the known disease genes, and the uncovered biological mechanisms are more diversified.

Methods: The single-cell sequencing data for colorectal cancer, specifically GSE132465 and GSE188711, were retrieved from the GEO database. Simultaneously, bulk transcriptome data were obtained from the UCSC Xena website. To delve into the heterogeneity of Treg cells and identify key genes at the single-cell sequencing level, we employed dimensionality reduction techniques alongside clustering and conducted differential expression gene analysis. For the bulk transcriptome data, we utilized weighted co-expression network analysis to investigate critical gene modules. Additionally, we employed COX regression and Lasso regression methodologies to construct prognostic models, thereby assessing patient outcomes. To facilitate outcome evaluation, nomograms were constructed. The integration of these diverse approaches aims to comprehensively study colorectal cancer, encompassing single-cell heterogeneity, key gene identification, and prognosis modeling using both single-cell and bulk transcriptome data. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments are used to verify mRNA expression levels of key genes. The analysis software was R software (version 4.3.2). Results: Through single-cell sequencing analysis and bulk transcriptome analysis, we constructed a prognostic model composed with Treg-associated signatures. The high-risk group demonstrated significantly worse prognosis compared with the low-risk group, highlighting the clinical relevance of our models.

With Mammaprint, Oncotype DX, and many other prognostic molecular signatures breast cancer is one of the paradigmatic examples of the utility of high-throughput data to deliver prognostic biomarkers, that can be represented in a form of a rather short gene list. Such gene lists can be obtained as a set of features (genes) that are important for the decisions of a Machine Learning (ML) method applied to high-dimensional gene expression data. Several studies have identified predictive gene lists for patient prognosis in breast cancer, but these lists are unstable and have only a few genes in common. Instability of feature selection impedes biological interpretability: genes that are relevant for cancer pathology should be members of any predictive gene list obtained for the same clinical type of patients. Stability and interpretability of selected features can be improved by including information on molecular networks in ML methods. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) is a contemporary deep learning approach applicable to gene expression data structured by a prior knowledge molecular network. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are methods to explain individual decisions of deep learning models. We used both GCNN+LRP and GCNN+SHAP techniques to construct feature sets by aggregating individual explanations. We suggest a methodology to systematically and quantitatively analyze the stability, the impact on the classification performance, and the interpretability of the selected feature sets. We used this methodology to compare GCNN+LRP to GCNN+SHAP and to more classical ML-based feature selection approaches. Utilizing a large breast cancer gene expression dataset we show that, while feature selection with SHAP is useful in applications where selected features have to be impactful for classification performance, among all studied methods GCNN+LRP delivers the most stable (reproducible) and interpretable gene lists.",Classification of cancer | Deep learning on graphs | Explainable AI | Feature selection | Gene expression data | Interpretability | Molecular networks | Prior knowledge | Stability,8,1,all publisherhybridgold,All Open Access Hybrid Gold,BMBF,031L0024A,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung

Methods: This study explored potential biomarkers for OS metastasis by analysing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to tackle class imbalances, while genes were selected using four feature selection algorithms (Monte Carlo feature selection [MCFS], Borota, minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance [mRMR], and light gradient-boosting machine [LightGBM]) based on the gene expression matrix. Four machine learning (ML) algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], random forest [RF], and k-nearest neighbours [kNN]) were utilized to determine the optimal number of genes for building the model. Interpretable machine learning (IML) was applied to construct prediction networks, revealing potential relationships among the selected genes. Additionally, enrichment analysis, survival analysis, and immune infiltration were performed on the featured genes. Results: In DS1, DS2, and DS3, the IML algorithm identified 53, 45, and 46 features, respectively. Using the merged gene set, we obtained a total of 79 interpretable prediction rules for OS metastasis. We subsequently conducted an in-depth investigation on 39 crucial molecules associated with predicting OS metastasis, elucidating their roles within the tumour microenvironment. Importantly, we found that certain genes act as both predictors and differentially expressed genes. Finally, our study unveiled statistically significant differences in survival between the high and low expression groups of TRIP4, S100A9, SELL and SLC11A1, and there was a certain correlation between these genes and 22 various immune cells.

Support vector machine (SVM), as a classical machine learning algorithm, has been widely used in cancer diagnosis because of its advantages in high-dimensional and small sample data. However, due to the high-dimensional feature space and high feature redundancy of gene expression data, SVM faces the problem of poor classification effect when dealing with such data. Methods Based on this, this paper proposes a hybrid feature selection algorithm combining information gain and grouping particle swarm optimization (IG-GPSO). The algorithm firstly calculates the information gain values of the features and ranks them in descending order according to the value. Then, ranked features are grouped according to the information index, so that the features in the group are close, and the features outside the group are sparse. Finally, grouped features are searched using grouping PSO and evaluated according to in-group and out-group. Results Experimental results show that the average accuracy (ACC) of the SVM on the feature subset selected by the IG-GPSO is 98.50%, which is significantly better than the traditional feature selection algorithm. Compared with KNN, the classification effect of the feature subset selected by the IG-GPSO is still optimal. In addition, the results of multiple comparison tests show that the feature selection effect of the IG-GPSO is significantly better than that of traditional feature selection algorithms. Conclusion The feature subset selected by IG-GPSO not only has the best classification effect, but also has the least feature scale (FS). More importantly, the IG-GPSO significantly improves the ACC of SVM in cancer diagnostic.",,10,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NSFC,"62276092,62303167",National Natural Science Foundation of China

The method is called weighted combination of Łukasiewicz implication and fuzzy Jaccard similarity in hybrid ensemble framework (WCLFJHEF). While the fuzziness in Jaccard similarity is incorporated by using the existing Gödel fuzzy logic, the weights are obtained by maximizing the average F-score of selected genes in classifying the cancer patients. The patients are first divided into different clusters, based on the number of patient groups, using average linkage agglomerative clustering and a new score, called WCLFJ (weighted combination of Łukasiewicz implication and fuzzy Jaccard similarity). The genes are then selected from each cluster separately using filter based Relief-F and wrapper based SVMRFE (Support Vector Machine with Recursive Feature Elimination). A gene (feature) pool is created by considering the union of selected features for all the clusters. A set of informative genes is selected from the pool using sequential backward floating search (SBFS) algorithm. Patients are then classified using Naïve Bayes’(NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) separately, using the selected genes and the related F-scores are calculated. The weights in WCLFJ are then updated iteratively to maximize the average F-score obtained from the results of the classifier. The effectiveness of WCLFJHEF is demonstrated on six gene expression datasets. The average values of accuracy, F-score, recall, precision and MCC over all the datasets, are 95%, 94%, 94%, 94%, and 90%, respectively.

The relevance of the selected gene set are biologically validated using the KEGG Pathway, Gene Ontology (GO), and existing literatures.

Although researchers have begun to study cancer differentiation and subtype prediction, most of relevant methods are based on traditional machine learning and rely on single omics data. It is necessary to explore a deep learning algorithm that integrates multi-omics data to achieve classification prediction of cancer differentiation and subtypes. Methods: This paper proposes a multi-omics data fusion algorithm based on a multi-view graph neural network (MVGNN) for predicting cancer differentiation and subtype classification. The model framework consists of a graph convolutional network (GCN) module for learning features from different omics data and an attention module for integrating multi-omics data. Three different types of omics data are used. For each type of omics data, feature selection is performed using methods such as the chi-square test and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). Weighted patient similarity networks are constructed based on the selected omics features, and GCN is trained using omics features and corresponding similarity networks. Finally, an attention module integrates different types of omics features and performs the final cancer classification prediction. Results: To validate the cancer classification predictive performance of the MVGNN model, we conducted experimental comparisons with traditional machine learning models and currently popular methods based on integrating multi-omics data using 5-fold cross-validation.

Dysregulated expression of DAPK1 has been associated with the invasive behavior of various malignancies, including gliomas. However, the precise role and underlying mechanisms of DAPK1 in gliomas remain inadequately understood. Methods: We performed analyses on RNA-seq and microarray datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), in addition to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from glioma patients available in GEO. Utilizing the Seurat R package, we identified gene clusters associated with survival from the scRNA-seq data. Prognostic models were developed using LASSO and stepwise regression algorithms. Furthermore, we assessed the predictive potential of these genes within the immune microenvironment and their relevance in immunotherapy contexts. Results: Our scRNA-seq data analysis revealed 32 distinct cell clusters corresponding to 10 cell types. Through dimensionality reduction and clustering, we identified three glial cell subpopulations based on their differentiation trajectories. DAPK1, serving as a marker gene for the terminal subpopulation, exhibited an association with poor prognosis. Conclusions: DAPK1-based prognostic models show promise for accurately predicting outcomes in glioblastoma and glioma. An in-depth examination of DAPK1’s specific mechanisms in glioblastoma could elucidate its role in immunotherapy response.

This study proposes a novel framework called 'Variance Score and Pearson Similarity based Unsupervised Feature Selection (VPUFS)', a feature selection fashion to choose relevant features, for reducing high dimensionality of unlabeled datasets, thereby helping as a preprocessing step to cluster cancer samples effectively. The unsupervised dimensionality reduction framework leverages variance to calculate feature class relevance score, and similarity metrics to identify and retain informative features while eliminating the redundant ones. The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated across multiple gene profiles, such as, Leukemia, Prostate, Breast and Colon cancer samples.

Given cells of each type are functionally consistent, incorporating biological relations among genes may improve the clustering results. In light of this, we have developed a deep-embedded clustering method, G3DC. This method combines a graph regularization based on the pre-existing gene network and a feature selector based on the l2,1 -norm regularization, along with a reconstruction loss, to generate a discriminatory and informative embedding. Utilizing the gene interaction network bolsters the clustering performance and aids in selecting functionally coherent genes, consequently enriching the clustering results.

We refer to these associations as gene mutation structural information, which implicitly includes cancer subtype information and can enhance subtype clustering. We introduce a novel method for cancer subtype clustering called SIG(Structural Information within Graph). As cancer is driven by a combination of genes, we establish associations between mutated genes within the same patient sample, pair by pair, and use a graph to represent them. An association between two mutated genes corresponds to an edge in the graph. We then merge these associations among all mutated genes to obtain a structural information graph, which enriches the gene network and improves its relevance to cancer clustering. We integrate the somatic tumor genome with the enriched gene network and propagate it to cluster patients with mutations in similar network regions.

Nevertheless, only about half of individuals treated with CBT benefit from it. Predictive algorithms, including digital assessments and passive sensing features, could better identify patients who would benefit from CBT, and thus, improve treatment choices. Objective: This study aims to establish predictive features that forecast responses to transdiagnostic CBT in anxiety disorders and to investigate key mechanisms underlying treatment responses. Methods: This study is a 2-armed randomized controlled clinical trial. We include patients with anxiety disorders who are randomized to either a transdiagnostic CBT group or a waitlist (referred to as WAIT). We index key features to predict responses prior to starting treatment using subjective self-report questionnaires, experimental tasks, biological samples, ecological momentary assessments, activity tracking, and smartphone-based passive sensing to derive a multimodal feature set for predictive modeling. Additional assessments take place weekly at mid- and posttreatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups to index anxiety and depression symptom severity. We aim to include 150 patients, randomized to CBT versus WAIT at a 3:1 ratio. The data set will be subject to full feature and important features selected by minimal redundancy and maximal relevance feature selection and then fed into machine leaning models, including eXtreme gradient boosting, pattern recognition network, and k-nearest neighbors to forecast treatment response. The performance of the developed models will be evaluated. In addition to predictive modeling, we will test specific mechanistic hypotheses (eg, association between self-efficacy, daily symptoms obtained using ecological momentary assessments, and treatment response) to elucidate mechanisms underlying treatment response. Results: The trial is now completed. It was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee, Zurich.

Methods: Two hundred twenty-eight patients with NF-PNETs undergoing MRI at 5 centers were retrospectively analyzed. Data from center 1 (n = 115) constituted the training cohort, and data from centers 2–5 (n = 113) constituted the testing cohort. Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted images and the apparent diffusion coefficient. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was applied to select the most important features and to develop radiomics signatures. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was performed to assess models. Results: Tumor boundary, enhancement homogeneity, and vascular invasion were used to construct the radiological model to stratify NF-PNET patients into grade 1 and 2/3 groups, which yielded AUC of 0.884 and 0.684 in the training and testing groups. A radiomics model including 4 features was constructed, with an AUC of 0.941 and 0.871 in the training and testing cohorts. The fusion model combining the radiomics signature and radiological characteristics showed good performance in the training set (AUC = 0.956) and in the testing set (AUC = 0.864), respectively. Conclusion: The developed model that integrates radiomics features with radiological characteristics could be used as a non-invasive, dependable, and accurate tool for the preoperative prediction of grade in NF-PNETs. Clinical relevance statement: Our study revealed that the fusion model based on a non-contrast MR sequence can be used to predict the histologic grade before operation. The radiomics model may be a new and effective biological marker in NF-PNETs. Key Points: The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model and fusion model was better than that of the model based on clinical information and radiological features in predicting grade 1 and 2/3 of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PNETs). Good performance of the model in the four external testing cohorts indicated that the radiomics model and fusion model for predicting the grades of NF-PNETs were robust and reliable, indicating the two models could be used in the clinical setting and facilitate the surgeons’ decision on risk stratification. The radiomics features were selected from non-contrast T2-weighted images (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequence, which means that the administration of contrast agent was not needed in grading the NF-PNETs.",Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging | Neuroendocrine tumors | Pancreatic neoplasms | Prediction model | Radiomics,20,1,all publisherhybridgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Hybrid Gold Green,NSFC,20191103,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In many cases, it is necessary to eliminate noise and identify truly useful features for better data analysis and modeling. In labeled data, algorithms such as correlation analysis or embedded selection methods can be used to select features most relevant to the labels. However, these algorithms are not effective for unlabeled data. Currently, common methods involve selecting features with higher variance or, based on feature correlation, identifying central features from a group of related features. This paper proposes a new method for feature selection using self-representation of data. The idea is that features in high-dimensional biological big data exhibit some redundancy, and redundant features can be represented by other features. Therefore, it is only necessary to find a subset of features, from which the entire dataset can be generated. This subset may represent more essential and important features. Using this subset for subsequent work can resist certain noise and reduce complexity, thereby improving algorithm performance. The paper presents a framework that can use linear models and non-linear neural network models to select feature subsets. Experiments compared the proposed method with popular unsupervised feature selection methods, using KMeans, KNN, and SVM as classification methods to classify the original data and the data after feature selection, and analyzed the results. The experiments ultimately demonstrated that the proposed method in this paper outperforms other popular unsupervised feature selection methods on multiple biological datasets.",feature selection | linear regression | mean square error | neural network | unsupervised learning,0,0,,,,2024KY0602,

Mostly cancer datasets contain various gene expression levels as features with less samples, so firstly there is a need to eliminate similar features to permit faster convergence rate of classification algorithms. These features (genes) enable us to identify cancer disease, choose the best prescription to prevent cancer and discover deviations amid different techniques. To resolve this problem, we proposed a hybrid novel technique CSSMO-based gene selection for cancer classification. First, we made alteration of the fitness of spider monkey optimization (SMO) with cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) algorithm viz., CSSMO for feature selection, which helps to combine the benefit of both metaheuristic algorithms to discover a subset of genes which helps to predict a cancer disease in early stage. Further, to enhance the accuracy of the CSSMO algorithm, we choose a cleaning process, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) to lessen the gene expression of cancer datasets. Next, these subsets of genes are classified using deep learning (DL) to identify different groups or classes related to a particular cancer disease. Eight different benchmark microarray gene expression datasets of cancer have been utilized to analyze the performance of the proposed approach with different evaluation matrix such as recall, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

To add insult to injury, usually the number of features is greater than number of samples in microarray gene dataset which leads to an ill-posed underdetermined equation system. Poor performance and high computational time for learning algorithms are consequences of redundant features in high-dimensional data. Feature selection is a noteworthy pre-processing method to ameliorate the curse of dimensionality with aim of maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy information preservation. Likewise, unsupervised feature selection has been important since collecting labels for data is expensive. In this paper, we develop a novel robust unsupervised feature selection to select discriminative subset of features for unlabeled data based on rank constrained and dual regularized nonnegative matrix factorization. The major focus of the proposed technique is to discard redundant features while keeping the informative features. Proposed feature selection technique consists of nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the data into feature weight matrix and representation matrix, inner product norm as regularization for both feature weight matrix and representation matrix, adaptive structure learning to preserve local information and Schatten-p norm as rank constraint. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical studies are conducted on six benchmark microarray datasets.

Patients and methods: A total of 116 ICC patients were included (training: 86; external validation: 30). The enhanced CT images were performed for the radiomics model. The logistic regression analysis was applied for the clinical model. The combined model was based on the clinical and radiomics models. Results: A total of 107 radiomics features were extracted, and after being eliminated and selected, six features were combined to establish a radiomics model for TLSs prediction. Arterial phase diffuse hyperenhancement and AJCC 8th stage were combined to construct a clinical model. The combined (radiomics nomogram) model outperformed both the independent radiomics model and clinical model in the training cohort (AUC, 0.85 vs. 0.82 and 0.75, respectively) and was validated in the external validation cohort (AUC, 0.88 vs. 0.86 and 0.71, respectively). Patients in the rad-score no less than −0.76 (low-risk) group showed significantly better RFS than those in the less than −0.76 (high-risk) group (p < 0.001, C-index = 0.678). Patients in the nomogram score no less than −1.16 (low-risk) group showed significantly better RFS than those of the less than −1.16 (high-risk) group (p < 0.001, C-index = 0.723). Conclusions: CT radiomics nomogram could serve as a preoperative biomarker of intra-tumoral TLSs status, better than independent radiomics or clinical models; preoperative CT radiomics nomogram achieved accurate stratification for RFS of ICC patients, better than the postoperative pathologic TLSs status. Critical relevance statement: The radiomics nomogram showed better performance in predicting TLSs than independent radiomics or clinical models and better prognosis stratification than postoperative pathologic TLSs status in ICC patients, which may facilitate identifying patients benefiting most from surgery and subsequent immunotherapy. Key points: • The combined (radiomics nomogram) model consisted of the radiomics model and clinical model (arterial phase diffuse hyperenhancement and AJCC 8th stage). • The radiomics nomogram showed better performance in predicting TLSs than independent radiomics or clinical models in ICC patients. • Preoperative CT radiomics nomogram achieved more accurate stratification for RFS of ICC patients than the postoperative pathologic TLSs status.

The survival disparity is particularly striking among (estrogen receptor positive) ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cases. The purpose of this study is to examine whether there are racial differences in metabolic pathways typically activated in patients with ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer. We collected pretreatment plasma from AA and NHW ER+ breast cancer cases (AA n = 48, NHW n = 54) and cancer-free controls (AA n = 100, NHW n = 48) to conduct an untargeted metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) to identify metabolites that may be altered in the different racial groups. Unpaired t-test combined with multiple feature selection and prediction models were employed to identify race-specific altered metabolic signatures. This was followed by the identification of altered metabolic pathways with a focus in AA patients with breast cancer. The clinical relevance of the identified pathways was further examined in PanCancer Atlas breast cancer data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). We identified differential metabolic signatures between NHW and AA patients. In AA patients, we observed decreased circulating levels of amino acids compared to healthy controls, while fatty acids were significantly higher in NHW patients. By mapping these metabolites to potential epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, this study identified significant associations with regulators of metabolism such as methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A), DNA Methyltransferases and Histone methyltransferases for AA individuals, and Fatty acid Synthase (FASN) and Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) for NHW individuals. Specific gene Negative Elongation Factor Complex E (NELFE) with histone methyltransferase activity, was associated with poor survival exclusively for AA individuals. We employed a comprehensive and novel approach that integrates multiple machine learning and statistical methods, coupled with human functional pathway analyses. The metabolic profile of plasma samples identified may help elucidate underlying molecular drivers of disproportionately aggressive ER+ tumor biology in AA women. It may ultimately lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. To our knowledge, this is a novel finding that describes a link between metabolic alterations and epigenetic regulation in AA breast cancer and underscores the need for detailed investigations into the biological underpinnings of breast cancer health disparities.",,18,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NIH,T32EB019944,National Institutes of Health

Methods We analyzed the axial T2-weighted images (T2WI) and T1-weighted contrast-enhancement images of preoperative MRI in 217 patients with pathologically diagnosed GBM. Patients were divided into negative and positive VEGF groups, with the latter group further subdivided into low and high expression.

The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated for the training and validation sets. Results Positive VEGF in GBM was 63.1% (137/217), with a high expression ratio of 53.3% (73/137). To predict the positive and negative VEGF expression, 7 radiomic features were selected, with 3 features from T1CE and 4 from T2WI. The accuracy and AUC were 0.83 and 0.81, respectively, in the training set and were 0.73 and 0.74, respectively, in the validation set.

Its classification efficiently depends on a data preprocessing procedure, where feature selection and signal categorization are the main work for generating input signals. Several methods have been employed (e.g., correlation coefficient and rough set theory). Those studies preferred to measure the importance of features by evaluating their relevance to the class. Generally, they determined a mapping relationship between important features and signal categories of DCA based on expert knowledge. Typically, those studies ignore the effect of unimportant features, and the mapping relationship determined by expertise may not produce an optimal classification result. Thus, a hybrid model, GA-DCA, is proposed for feature selection and signal categorization based on the genetic algorithm (GA). This study transforms feature selection and signal categorization into a grouping task (i.e., divides features into different signal groups). This study introduces a permutation-based expression with “Group"" symbols to represent a potential feature grouping scheme. Correspondingly, adaptive operators are proposed to expand each possible scheme on the path from the initial feature grouping to the best feature grouping.

Locality preserving projection (LPP) is a dimensionality reduction approach to mitigate the data redundancy while preserving the substantial geometry inspired by biological processes. Its application can contribute promisingly to the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. However, the existing locality preserving based FCM clustering methods that combine LPP with FCM focus only on the local information, probably resulting in somewhat conservatism. A novel FCM clustering method, namely, projected fuzzy double c-means clustering using sparse self-representation (PFD SSR), is developed in this paper. The main idea of PFD SSR is three-fold: (1) Inspired by biological processes, a so-called sparse self-representation (SSR) method is employed. Hence, the global data distribution is investigated so as to enhance the clustering performance; (2) LPP is utilized to handle both the raw data and the dictionary matrix obtained by SSR, which greatly reduces the feature dimensions and solidly preserves the intrinsic data distribution. In addition, the regularization terms of these two achievements under projection are introduced to the FCM’s objective function, which helps reduce the risk of being trapped into local optima during the model training; and (3) the alternative direction technique is applied to learn the model. The experimental results on 11 datasets including 6 biologically data sets demonstrated the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art clustering methods.

Existing unsupervised feature selection algorithms primarily focus on the significance of features in maintaining the data structure while not taking into account the redundancy among features. Determining the appropriate number of significant features is another challenge. (Method) In this paper, we propose a clustering-guided unsupervised feature selection (CGUFS) algorithm for gene expression data that addresses these problems. Our proposed algorithm introduces three improvements over existing algorithms. For the problem that existing clustering algorithms require artificially specifying the number of clusters, we propose an adaptive k-value strategy to assign appropriate pseudo-labels to each sample by iteratively updating a change function. For the problem that existing algorithms fail to consider the redundancy among features, we propose a feature grouping strategy to group highly redundant features. For the problem that the existing algorithms cannot filter the redundant features, we propose an adaptive filtering strategy to determine the feature combinations to be retained by calculating the potentially effective features and potentially redundant features of each feature group. (Result) Experimental results show that the average accuracy (ACC) and matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) indexes of the C4.5 classifier on the optimal features selected by the CGUFS algorithm reach 74.37% and 63.84%, respectively, significantly superior to the existing algorithms.

Predicting circRNA-disease associations will provide essential clues to reveal molecular mechanisms of disease development and discover novel therapeutic targets. Existing algorithms ignore the heterogeneous biological association information related to microRNAs (miRNAs). Based on a heterogeneous graph embedding model, a novel circRNA-disease association prediction method called HGECDA is developed in this paper. The heterogeneous graph network containing circRNA-miRNA-disease association information is first constructed. To sample the heterogeneous information, the meta-path-based random walk that can capture the relevance between various types of nodes is employed. Then, the path embedding model based on skip-gram and random negative sampling is built to acquire the initial feature vectors of circRNAs and diseases. Finally, the CosMulformer model with linearized self-attention and Hadamard product is designed to obtain the circRNA-disease interaction vectors and conduct the prediction task. Experimental results demonstrate the critical role of miRNA in enriching the information of the feature space, the effectiveness of the CosMulformer model in picking out deep local interaction features, and the feasibility of the Hadamard product chosen as the integration pattern in the CosMulformer model. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset, HGECDA performs better than the other seven algorithms. Moreover, the case studies about breast cancer and colorectal cancer demonstrate the practical value of HGECDA in predicting potential circRNA-disease associations.",CircRNA-disease association | graph embedding | heterogeneous graph network | random walk,11,0,,,,,

Methods: This was an IRB-Approved retrospective study of 137 subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with subfoveal GA. Based on sfGA status at year five, eyes were categorized as 'Progressors' and 'Non-progressors'. FD analysis allows quantification of the degree of shape complexity and architectural disorder associated with a structure. To characterize the structural irregularities along the sub-RPE surface between the two groups of patients, a total of 15 shape descriptors of FD were extracted from the sub-RPE compartment of baseline OCT scans. The top four features were identified using minimum Redundancy maximum Relevance (mRmR) feature selection method and evaluated with Random Forest (RF) classifier using three-fold cross validation from the training set (N = 90). Classifier performance was subsequently validated on the independent test set (N = 47). Results: Using the top four FD features, a RF classifier yielded an AUC of 0.85 on the independent test set. Mean fractal entropy (p-value = 4.8e-05) was identified as the most significant biomarker; higher values of entropy being associated with greater shape disorder and risk for sfGA progression. Conclusions: FD assessment holds promise for identifying high-risk eyes for GA progression. Significance: With further validation, FD features could be potentially used for clinical trial enrichment and assessments for therapeutic response in dry AMD patients.",age-related macular degeneration (AMD) | fractal dimension (FD) | spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) | sub-retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) | Subfoveal geographic atrophy (sfGA),3,2,all repository repositoryam,All Open Access Green,,,

This retrospective study aimed to assess its prognostic value in high-grade glioma (HGG) and predict C5aR1 expression using a radiomics approach. Methods: Among 298 patients with HGG, 182 with MRI data were randomly divided into training and test groups for radiomics analysis. We examined the association between C5aR1 expression and prognosis through Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses. We used maximum relevance–minimum redundancy and recursive feature elimination algorithms for radiomics feature selection. We then built a support vector machine (SVM) and a logistic regression model, investigating their performances using receiver operating characteristic, calibration curves, and decision curves. Results: C5aR1 expression was elevated in HGG and was an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 3.984, 95% CI: 2.834–5.607). Both models presented with >0.8 area under the curve values in the training and test datasets, indicating efficient discriminatory ability, with SVM performing marginally better. The radiomics score calculated using the SVM model correlated significantly with overall survival (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results highlight C5aR1’s role in HGG development and prognosis, supporting its potential as a prognostic biomarker.

The development of radiation-induced fibrosis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) can obscure follow-up images and delay detection of a local recurrence in early-stage lung cancer patients. The objective of this study was to develop a radiomics model for computer-assisted detection of local recurrence and fibrosis for an earlier timepoint (<1 year) after the SABR treatment. Approach. This retrospective clinical study included CT images (n = 107) of 66 patients treated with SABR. A z-score normalization technique was used for radiomic feature standardization across scanner protocols. The training set for the radiomics model consisted of CT images (66 patients; 22 recurrences and 44 fibrosis) obtained at 24 months (median) follow-up. The test set included CT-images of 41 patients acquired at 5-12 months follow-up. Combinations of four widely used machine learning techniques (support vector machines, gradient boosting, random forests (RF), and logistic regression) and feature selection methods (Relief feature scoring, maximum relevance minimum redundancy, mutual information maximization, forward feature selection, and LASSO) were investigated. Pyradiomics was used to extract 106 radiomic features from the CT-images for feature selection and classification. Main results. An RF + LASSO model scored the highest in terms of AUC (0.87) and obtained a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 88% in identifying a local recurrence in the test set. In the training set, 86% accuracy was achieved using five-fold cross-validation. Delong’s test indicated that AUC achieved by the RF+LASSO is significantly better than 11 other machine learning models presented here. The top three radiomic features: interquartile range (first order), Cluster Prominence (GLCM), and Autocorrelation (GLCM), were revealed as differentiating a recurrence from fibrosis with this model. Significance. The radiomics model selected, out of multiple machine learning and feature selection algorithms, was able to differentiate a recurrence from fibrosis in earlier follow-up CT-images with a high specificity rate and satisfactory sensitivity performance.",computed tomography | local recurrence | machine learning | non-small cell lung cancer | radiomics | stereotactic ablative radiotherapy,4,1,all publisherhybridgold,All Open Access Hybrid Gold,,,BC Cancer Foundation

Results: We develop CellBRF, a feature selection method that considers genes' relevance to cell types for single-cell clustering. The key idea is to identify genes that are most important for discriminating cell types through random forests guided by predicted cell labels. Moreover, it proposes a class balancing strategy to mitigate the impact of unbalanced cell type distributions on feature importance evaluation. We benchmark CellBRF on 33 scRNA-seq datasets representing diverse biological scenarios and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of clustering accuracy and cell neighborhood consistency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the outstanding performance of our selected features through three case studies on cell differentiation stage identification, non-malignant cell subtype identification, and rare cell identification.

Objectives: To determine the point prevalence of PCC 6 months after the acute infection, to determine the risk of development of PCC adjusted for possible confounders, and to explore a broad range of potential risk factors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included nonhospitalized individuals from 2 counties in Norway between ages 12 and 25 years who underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. At the early convalescent stage and at 6-month follow-up, participants underwent a clinical examination; pulmonary, cardiac, and cognitive functional testing; immunological and organ injury biomarker analyses; and completion of a questionnaire. Participants were classified according to the World Health Organization case definition of PCC at follow-up. Association analyses of 78 potential risk factors were performed. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: The point prevalence of PCC 6 months after RT-PCR testing in the SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative groups, and the risk difference with corresponding 95% CIs. Results: A total of 404 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 105 individuals testing negative were enrolled (194 male [38.1%]; 102 non-European [20.0%] ethnicity). A total of 22 of the SARS-CoV-2-positive and 4 of the SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were lost to follow-up, and 16 SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were excluded due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the observational period. Hence, 382 SARS-CoV-2-positive participants (mean [SD] age, 18.0 [3.7] years; 152 male [39.8%]) and 85 SARS-CoV-2-negative participants (mean [SD] age, 17.7 [3.2] years; 31 male [36.5%]) could be evaluated. The point prevalence of PCC at 6 months was 48.5% in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group and 47.1% in the control group (risk difference, 1.5%; 95% CI, -10.2% to 13.1%). SARS-CoV-2 positivity was not associated with the development of PCC (relative risk [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.37; final multivariable model utilizing modified Poisson regression). The main risk factor for PCC was symptom severity at baseline (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.27-1.56). Low physical activity (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-1.00) and loneliness (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02) were also associated, while biological markers were not. Symptom severity correlated with personality traits. Conclusions and Relevance: The persistent symptoms and disability that characterize PCC are associated with factors other than SARS-CoV-2 infection, including psychosocial factors. This finding raises questions about the utility of the World Health Organization case definition and has implications for the planning of health care services as well as for further research on PCC..",,80,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,EC,201809-2016862,Familjen Erling-Perssons Stiftelse

However, computational limitations thwart this process due to the intricacy of the biological networks and the curse of dimensionality of gene expression data. Therefore, clustering in such scenarios often becomes the first choice of exploratory data analysis to identify natural structures and intrinsic patterns in the data. However, sparse and high dimensional nature of omics data prevents conventional clustering algorithms to discover subtypes that are clinically relevant and statistically significant. Hence, non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques coupled with clustering in such scenarios often becomes imperative to improve the clustering results. In this study, we present a robust pipeline to discover disease subtypes with clinical relevance. Specifically, we focus on discovering patient sub-groups that have a residual life patterns remarkably different from other sub-groups. This is significant because by refining prognosis, subtyping can reduce uncertainty in approximating patients expected outcome. The methodology present is based on robust correlation estimation, UMAP– a non-linear dimensionality reduction method and mapper– a tool from topology. Notably, we suggest a method for improving the robustness of the correlation matrix of gene expression data for improving the clustering results. The performance of the model is evaluated by applying to five cancer datasets obtained through TCGA and comparisons are performed with some state of the art methods of NEMO, RSC-OTRI and SNF with regard to log−rank test and Restricted Life Expectancy Difference. For example in GBM dataset, the minimum separation for any two discovered subtypes is 221 days which is significantly higher than the other methodologies. We also compared the results without using the robust correlation based estimate and observed that robust correlation improves separability between survival curves significantly.

The specific molecular processes allowing autoreactive immune cells to enter the CNS compartment through the blood-brain barrier remain elusive.MethodsUsing endothelial cell (EC) enrichment and single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cells implicated in the neuroinflammatory processes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. Validations on human MS brain sections of the most differentially expressed genes in venous ECs were performed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.ResultsWe found an upregulation of genes associated with antigen presentation and interferon in most populations of CNS-resident cells, including ECs. Interestingly, instead of transcriptionally distinct profiles, a continuous gradient of gene expression separated the arteriovenous zonation of the brain vasculature. However, differential gene expression analysis presented more transcriptomic alterations on the venous side of the axis, suggesting a prominent role of venous ECs in neuroinflammation. Furthermore, analysis of ligand-receptor interactions identified important potential molecular communications between venous ECs and infiltrated immune populations. To confirm the relevance of our observation in the context of human disease, we validated the protein expression of the most upregulated genes (Ackr1 and Lcn2) in MS lesions.DiscussionIn this study, we provide a landscape of the cellular heterogeneity associated with neuroinflammation.

However, current solutions often rely on combination of imaging (chest X-ray, low dose CT scan) with blood sample and clinical data. While this could push the boundary in the non-invasive screening, diagnosis, and classification of lung cancers, it would be challenging to deploy in the primary care or in remote secondary care settings.

Modeling the human microbiome using machine learning models has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, colorectal cancer, and many others. The goal of this study is to develop an effective classification model for the analysis of metagenomic datasets associated with different diseases. In this way, we aim to identify taxonomic biomarkers associated with these diseases and facilitate disease diagnosis. The microBiomeGSM tool presented in this work incorporates the pre-existing taxonomy information into a machine learning approach and challenges to solve the classification problem in metagenomics disease-associated datasets. Based on the G-S-M (Grouping-Scoring-Modeling) approach, species level information is used as features and classified by relating their taxonomic features at different levels, including genus, family, and order. Using four different disease associated metagenomics datasets, the performance of microBiomeGSM is comparatively evaluated with other feature selection methods such as Fast Correlation Based Filter (FCBF), Select K Best (SKB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), Maximum Likelihood and Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) and Information Gain (IG), also with other classifiers such as AdaBoost, Decision Tree, LogitBoost and Random Forest. microBiomeGSM achieved the highest results with an Area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.98% at the order taxonomic level for IBDMD dataset. Another significant output of microBiomeGSM is the list of taxonomic groups that are identified as important for the disease under study and the names of the species within these groups. The association between the detected species and the disease under investigation is confirmed by previous studies in the literature.

This high dimensionality including redundancy and irrelevancy poses a great challenge in data analysis and decision making. Feature selection (FS) is an effective way to reduce dimensionality by eliminating redundant and irrelevant data. Most traditional FS approaches score and rank each feature individually; and then perform FS either by eliminating lower ranked features or by retaining highly-ranked features. In this review, we discuss an emerging approach to FS that is based on initially grouping features, then scoring groups of features rather than scoring individual features. Despite the presence of reviews on clustering and FS algorithms, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first review focusing on FS techniques based on grouping. The typical idea behind FS through grouping is to generate groups of similar features with dissimilarity between groups, then select representative features from each cluster. Approaches under supervised, unsupervised, semi supervised and integrative frameworks are explored. The comparison of experimental results indicates the effectiveness of sequential, optimization-based (i.e., fuzzy or evolutionary), hybrid and multi-method approaches. When it comes to biological data, the involvement of external biological sources can improve analysis results.

Among liver cancer types, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of the cases and is known to have a tumour promoting inflammation regardless of its underlying aetiology. However, current promising treatment approaches, such as immunotherapy, are partially effective for most of the patients due to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumour microenvironment (TME). Therefore, there is an urgent need to fully understand TME in HCC and discover new immune markers to eliminate resistance to immunotherapy. Methods: We analyse three microarray datasets, using unsupervised and supervised methods, in an effort to discover signature genes. First, univariate, and multivariate, feature selection methods, such as the Boruta algorithm, are applied. Subsequently, an optimisation procedure, which utilises random forest algorithm with three dataset pairs combinations, is performed. The resulting optimal gene sets are then combined and further subjected to network analysis and pathway enrichment analysis so as to obtain information related to their biological relevance. The microarray datasets were analysed via the MCP-counter, CIBERSORT, TIMER, EPIC, and quanTIseq deconvolution methods and an estimation of cell type abundances for each dataset sample were identified. The differences in the cell type abundances, between the adjacent and tumour sample groups, were then assessed using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (p-value < 0.05). Results: The optimal gene signature sets, derived from each of the data pairs combination, achieved AUC values ranging from 0.959 to 0.988 in external validation sets using Random Forest model. CLEC1B and PTTG1 genes are retrieved across each optimal set. Among the signature genes, PTTG1, AURKA, and UBE2C genes are found to be involved in the regulation of mitotic sister chromatid separation and anaphase-promoting complex (APC) dependent catabolic process (adjusted p-value < 0.001). Additionally, the application of deconvolution algorithms revealed significant changes in cell type abundances of Regulatory T (Treg) cells, M0 and M1 macrophages, and T CD8<sup>+</sup> cells between adjacent and tumour samples. Conclusion: We identified ECM1 gene as a potential immune-related marker acting through immune cell migration and macrophage polarisation. Our results indicate that macrophages, such as M0 macrophage and M1 macrophage cells, undergo significant changes in HCC TME. Moreover, our immune deconvolution approach revealed significant infiltration of Treg cells and M0 macrophages, and a significant decrease in T CD8<sup>+</sup> cells and M1 macrophages in tumour samples.",gene signature | hepatocellular carcinoma | immune deconvolution | tumor microenvironment,8,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,DH,731032,Department of Health and Social Care

Participants: Eighty-one participants with treatment-naïve nAMD from the OSPREY study, including 15 super responders (patients who achieved and maintained retinal fluid resolution) and 66 non–super responders (patients who did not achieve or maintain retinal fluid resolution). Methods: A total of 962 texture-based radiomic features were extracted from fluid, subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM), and different retinal tissue compartments of OCT scans. The top 8 features, chosen by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection method, were evaluated using 4 ML classifiers in a cross-validated approach to distinguish between the 2 patient groups. Longitudinal assessment of changes in different texture-based radiomic descriptors (delta-texture features) between baseline and month 3 also was performed to evaluate their association with treatment response.

Results: The cross-validated AUC by the quadratic discriminant analysis classifier was 0.75 ± 0.09 using texture-based baseline OCT features. The delta-texture features within different OCT compartments between baseline and month 3 yielded an AUC of 0.78 ± 0.08.

To achieve accurate cancer estimation, analysis pipelines for gene expression data (GED) may integrate a sequence of several machine learning and bio-statistical techniques to model complex characteristics of pathological patterns. Methods: Numerical experiments tested the combination of GED preprocessing by discretization with tree ensemble embeddings and nonlinear dimensionality reductions to categorize oncological patients comprehensively. Modeling aimed to identify tumor stage and distinguish survival outcomes in two situations: complete and partial data embedding. This latter experimental condition simulates the addition of new patients to an existing model for rapid monitoring of disease progression. Machine learning procedures were employed to identify the most relevant genes involved in patient prognosis and test the performance of preprocessed GED compared to untransformed data in predicting patient conditions. Results: Data embedding paired with dimensionality reduction produced prognostic maps with well-defined clusters of patients, suitable for medical decision support. A second experiment simulated the addition of new patients to an existing model (partial data embedding): Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) methodology with uniform data discretization led to better outcomes than other analyzed pipelines. Further exploration of parameter space for UMAP and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) underlined the importance of tuning a higher number of parameters for UMAP rather than t-SNE. Moreover, two different machine learning experiments identified a group of genes valuable for partitioning patients (gene relevance analysis) and showed the higher precision obtained by preprocessed data in predicting tumor outcomes for cancer stage and survival rate (six classes prediction). Conclusions: The present investigation proposed new analysis pipelines for disease outcome modeling from bladder cancer-related biomarkers. Complete and partial data embedding experiments suggested that pipelines employing UMAP had a more accurate predictive ability, supporting the recent literature trends on this methodology. However, it was also found that several UMAP parameters influence experimental results, therefore deriving a recommendation for researchers to pay attention to this aspect of the UMAP technique.

(PM) is a herb, extracts of which have been used as Chinese medicine for years. Although it is believed to be beneficial to the liver, heart, and kidneys, it causes idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Aim of the study: We propose that the intrinsic DILI caused by natural products in PM (NPPM) is an important complementary mechanism to PM-related herb-induced liver injury, and aim to identify the ingredients with high DILI potential by machine learning methods. Materials and methods: One hundred and ninety-seven NPPM were collected from the literature to identify the intrinsic hepatotoxic compounds. Additionally, a DILI-labeled dataset consisting of 2384 compounds was collected and randomly split into training and test sets. A diparametric optimization method was developed to tune the parameters of extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs), Rdkit, and atom-pair fingerprints as well as those of machine-learning (ML) algorithms. Subsequently, K means were employed to cluster the NPPM that were predicted to have a high DILI risk. An in vitro cell-viability assay was performed using HepaRG cells to validate the prediction results. Results: ECFPs with the top 35% of features ranked by the F-value with support vector machine (SVM) yielded the best performance. The optimized SVM model achieved an accuracy of 0.761 and recall value of 0.834 on the test dataset. The silico screening for NPPM resulted in 47 ingredients with high DILI potential, which were clustered into six groups based on the elbow method. A representative subgroup that contained 21 ingredients, of which two dianthrones exhibited the lowest IC<inf>50</inf> value (0.7–0.9 μM) and anthraquinones showed moderate toxicity (15–25 μM), was constructed. Conclusion: Using ML methods and in vitro screening, two classes of compounds, dianthrones and anthraquinones, were predicted and validated to have a high risk of DILI.

COVID-19 virus infection triggers a complex immune response. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in particular, play an essential role in controlling the severity of the disease. However, the mechanism of the regulatory role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on COVID-19 remains poorly investigated. In this study, single-cell gene expression profiles from three CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes (effector, memory, and naive T cells) were downloaded. Each cell subtype included three disease states, namely, acute COVID-19, convalescent COVID-19, and unexposed individuals. The profiles on each cell subtype were individually analyzed in the same way. Irrelevant features in the profiles were first excluded by the Boruta method. The remaining features for each CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells subtype were further analyzed by Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy, Monte Carlo feature selection, and light gradient boosting machine methods to obtain three feature lists. These lists were then brought into the incremental feature selection method to determine the optimal features for each cell subtype. Their corresponding genes may be latent biomarkers to determine COVID-19 severity. Genes, such as ZFP36, DUSP1, TCR, and IL7R, can be confirmed to play an immune regulatory role in COVID-19 infection and recovery. The results of functional enrichment analysis revealed that these important genes may be associated with immune functions, such as response to cAMP, response to virus, T cell receptor complex, T cell activation, and T cell differentiation. This study further set up different gene expression pattens, represented by classification rules, on three states of COVID-19 and constructed several efficient classifiers to distinguish COVID-19 severity.

Consequently, this study proposes a new feature selection method that integrates Preordonnances theory in terms of new Relevance and Complementarity criteria introduced here and also connectivity in undirected Weighted Graphs (PCRWG). The method can handle high-dimensional data. PCRWG retains the relevant and complementary features to select effective features in large scale gene datasets. The proposed algorithm operates in two phases: filtering and wrapping. The strength of the first phase is that it is preceded by a step that further reduces the number of predictors by removing those in disagreement with the target based on the new proposed relevance criterion. Then, the proposed heuristic uses the relevance-complementarity ratio between preordonnances to automatically update the compromise rule between relevance and complementarity. In the wrapping phase, the suggested graph-based approach using maximal clique is based on a powerful relevance-complementarity matrix to consolidate edges, two connected interdependent features are complementary to each other, and it is possible to have high discriminative power when they serve as a group. We highlight the fact that existing graph-based feature selection algorithms do not consider relevance and complementarity simultaneously. The experiments were carried out on three simulated scenarios and the thirteen most popular cancer microarray gene datasets. Formally, they are eight binary and five multi-class microarray data. A 10-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and artificial Neural Network (NN) classifiers.

Distinguishing between inflammatory liver diseases, which may have similar clinical presentations, is particularly challenging. In this study, we implemented a machine learning pipeline for the identification of diagnostic gene expression biomarkers across several alcohol-associated and non-alcohol-associated liver diseases, using either liver tissue or blood-based samples. Methods: We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and liver tissue samples from participants with alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC), non-alcohol-associated fatty liver disease, chronic HCV infection, and healthy controls. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 137 PBMC samples and 67 liver tissue samples. Using gene expression data, we implemented a machine learning feature selection and classification pipeline to identify diagnostic biomarkers which distinguish between the liver disease groups. The liver tissue results were validated using a public independent RNA-seq dataset. The biomarkers were computationally validated for biological relevance using pathway analysis tools. Results: Utilizing liver tissue RNA-seq data, we distinguished between AH, AC, and healthy conditions with overall accuracies of 90% in our dataset, and 82% in the independent dataset, with 33 genes. Distinguishing 4 liver conditions and healthy controls yielded 91% overall accuracy in our liver tissue dataset with 39 genes, and 75% overall accuracy in our PBMC dataset with 75 genes. Conclusions: Our machine learning pipeline was effective at identifying a small set of diagnostic gene biomarkers and classifying several liver diseases using RNA-seq data from liver tissue and PBMCs. The methodologies implemented and genes identified in this study may facilitate future efforts toward a liquid biopsy diagnostic for liver diseases. Lay summary: Distinguishing between inflammatory liver diseases without multiple tests can be challenging due to their clinically similar characteristics. To lay the groundwork for the development of a non-invasive blood-based diagnostic across a range of liver diseases, we compared samples from participants with alcohol-associated hepatitis, alcohol-associated cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C infection, and non-alcohol-associated fatty liver disease.

In this study, expression profiles of 142 peripheral blood samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Adipocytokine pathway-related genes were screened out by feature selection using machine-learning algorithms. A nomogram was then constructed and estimated for the efficacy of diagnosis. Cluster analysis was employed for the recognization of two distinct epilepsy subtypes, followed by an estimation of the immune cell infiltration levels using single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The biological characteristics were analyzed by functional enrichment analysis. The aberrant regulation of adipocytokine signaling pathway was found in the peripheral blood of patients with epilepsy. Twenty-one differently expressed adipocytokine pathway-related genes were identified and five (RELA, PRKAB1, TNFRSF1A, CAMKK2, and CPT1B) were selected to construct a nomogram. Subsequent validations of its forecasting ability revealed that this model has satisfactory predictive value. The immune cell infiltration degrees, such as those of innate immune cells and lymphocytes, were found to significantly correlate to the levels of adipocytokine pathway-related genes. Additionally, 239 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and their biological functions were mainly enriched in the regulation of the immune response.

Further validation was conducted using a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model. Results: Seven DHI-related response modules were identified. Eight drug response-related genes were screened out, and principal component analysis showed that DHI responders were distinguished from responders in the control group based on their expression values. The combination of the two most important genes, SHC4 and PIP5K1P1, discriminated between responders and nonresponders with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.714; however, no significant difference was found in the AUC between the combination and a single gene. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed that middle-dose DHI treatment significantly decreased SHC4 mRNA expression compared with that in the H/R group (P = 0.026), a finding consistent with our previous analysis of differentially expressed genes. Conclusions: DHI comprehensively exerted a therapeutic effect by acting on multiple response modules related to angina pectoris and drug response-related genes. Our findings indicate that the dimensionality reduction strategy based on the target network-drug response module-therapeutic targets can contribute to revealing the mechanism of action of TCM compounds and guiding precise clinical medication.",Chronic stable angina | Danhong injection (DHI) | Drug response module | Target network | Therapeutic target,9,0,,,NSFC,CI2021A05033,National Natural Science Foundation of China

However, such measurements do not provide information on the biological toxicity of PM. Oxidative potential (OP) is a complementary metric that aims to classify PM in respect to its oxidising ability in the lungs and is being increasingly reported due to its assumed relevance concerning human health. Between June 2018 and May 2019, an intensive filter-based PM sampling campaign was conducted across Switzerland in five locations, which involved the quantification of a large number of PM constituents and the OP for both PM10 and PM2.5. OP was quantified by three assays: ascorbic acid (AA), dithiothreitol (DTT), and dichlorofluorescein (DCFH). OPv (OP by air volume) was found to be variable over time and space: Bern-Bollwerk, an urban-traffic sampling site, had the greatest levels of OPv among the Swiss sites (especially when considering OPvAA), with more rural locations such as Payerne experiencing a lower OPv. However, urban-background and suburban sites experienced a significant OPv enhancement, as did the rural Magadino-Cadenazzo site during wintertime because of high levels of wood smoke. The mean OP ranges for the sampling period were 0.4-4.1gnmolmin-1m-3, 0.6-3.0gnmolmin-1m-3, and 0.3-0.7gnmolH2O2m-3 for OPvAA, OPvDTT, and OPvDCFH, respectively. A source allocation method using positive matrix factorisation (PMF) models indicated that although all PM10 and PM2.5 sources that were identified contributed to OPv, the anthropogenic road traffic and wood combustion sources had the greatest OPm potency (OP per PM mass) on average. A dimensionality reduction procedure coupled to multiple linear regression modelling consistently identified a handful of metals usually associated with non-exhaust emissions, namely copper, zinc, iron, tin, antimony, manganese, and cadmium, as well as three specific wood-burning-sourced organic tracers - levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan (or their metal substitutes: rubidium and potassium), as the most important PM components to explain and predict OPv. The combination of a metal and a wood-burning-specific tracer led to the best-performing linear models to explain OPv. Interestingly, within the non-exhaust and wood combustion emission groups, the exact choice of component was not critical; the models simply required a variable representing the emission source or process to be present. This analysis strongly suggests that anthropogenic and locally emitting road traffic and wood burning sources should be prioritised, targeted, and controlled to gain the most efficacious decrease in OPv and presumably biological harm reductions in Switzerland.",,51,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NERC,PJ/R152-0739,Natural Environment Research Council

It is of paramount importance to identify biomarkers in genomic data that could help predict the aggressiveness of ccRCC and its resistance to drugs. Thus, we conducted a study with the aims of evaluating gene signatures and proposing a novel one with higher predictive power and generalization in comparison to the former signatures. Using ccRCC cohorts of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-KIRC) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC-RECA), we evaluated linear survival models of Cox regression with 14 signatures and six methods of feature selection, and performed functional analysis and differential gene expression approaches. In this study, we established a 13-gene signature (AR, AL353637.1, DPP6, FOXJ1, GNB3, HHLA2, IL4, LIMCH1, LINC01732, OTX1, SAA1, SEMA3G, ZIC2) whose expression levels are able to predict distinct outcomes of patients with ccRCC. Moreover, we performed a comparison between our signature and others from the literature. The best-performing gene signature was achieved using the ensemble method Min-Redundancy and Max-Relevance (mRMR). This signature comprises unique features in comparison to the others, such as generalization through different cohorts and being functionally enriched in significant pathways: Urothelial Carcinoma, Chronic Kidney disease, and Transitional cell carcinoma, Nephrolithiasis. From the 13 genes in our signature, eight are known to be correlated with ccRCC patient survival and four are immune-related. Our model showed a performance of 0.82 using the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC) metric and it generalized well between the cohorts. Our findings revealed two clusters of genes with high expression (SAA1, OTX1, ZIC2, LINC01732, GNB3 and IL4) and low expression (AL353637.1, AR, HHLA2, LIMCH1, SEMA3G, DPP6, and FOXJ1) which are both correlated with poor prognosis.

Since single-cell data are susceptible to technical noise, the quality of genes selected prior to clustering is of crucial importance in the preliminary steps of downstream analysis. Therefore, interest in robust gene selection has gained considerable attention in recent years. We introduce sc-REnF [robust entropy based feature (gene) selection method], aiming to leverage the advantages of R/nyi and Tsallis entropies in gene selection for single cell clustering. Experiments demonstrate that with tuned parameter (q), R/nyi and Tsallis entropies select genes that improved the clustering results significantly, over the other competing methods. sc-REnF can capture relevancy and redundancy among the features of noisy data extremely well due to its robust objective function. Moreover, the selected features/genes can able to determine the unknown cells with a high accuracy. Finally, sc-REnF yields good clustering performance in small sample, large feature scRNA-seq data.

It has been suggested that the RG formalism may be useful in finding and interpreting emergent low-dimensional structure in complex systems outside of the traditional physics context, such as in biology or computer science. In such contexts, one common dimensionality-reduction framework already in use is information bottleneck (IB), in which the goal is to compress an 'input' signal X while maximizing its mutual information with some stochastic 'relevance' variable Y. IB has been applied in the vertebrate and invertebrate processing systems to characterize optimal encoding of the future motion of the external world. Other recent work has shown that the RG scheme for the dimer model could be 'discovered' by a neural network attempting to solve an IB-like problem. This manuscript explores whether IB and any existing formulation of RG are formally equivalent. A class of soft-cutoff non-perturbative RG techniques are defined by families of non-deterministic coarsening maps, and hence can be formally mapped onto IB, and vice versa. For concreteness, this discussion is limited entirely to Gaussian statistics (GIB), for which IB has exact, closed-form solutions. Under this constraint, GIB has a semigroup structure, in which successive transformations remain IB-optimal. Further, the RG cutoff scheme associated with GIB can be identified. Our results suggest that IB can be used to impose a notion of 'large scale' structure, such as biological function, on an RG procedure.",information bottleneck | non-perturbative | renormalization group | statistical physics,9,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NSF,PHY-1607611,National Science Foundation

To overcome the variability introduced from the small rat sample size, this work proposes a novel method for combining and running Genetic Feature Selection and Forward Stepwise Feature Selection in an environment where classification accuracy varies greatly based on how the folds are organized before cross-validation. Three separate classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest are used to verify the proposed method. For Logistic Regression, the set of Alpha Power (7-12 Hz), High Beta Power (20-30 Hz), and 55-95 Hz Gamma Power shows the best performance in classification. For k-Nearest Neighbor, the characterizing features are Low Beta Power (12-20 Hz), High Beta Power, All Beta Power (12-30 Hz), 55-95 Hz Gamma Power, and 95-105 Hz Gamma Power.

Second, these DEGs were validated by the literature review including disease relevance with the psychiatric disorders of these DEGs, the hub genes in the PPI (protein–protein interaction) network, and GO (gene ontology) terms and pathways. Third, a classification model was constructed using the identified DEGs by machine learning method to classify different groups.

There are many approaches to, and rationales for, catchment classification, with those focused on streamflow often seeking to relate a particular response characteristic to a physical property or climatic driver. Rationales include such topics as prediction in ungauged basins (PUB), and providing guidance for model selection in poorly understood hydrological systems. The annual daily hydrograph (ADH) is a first-order easily visualized integrated expression of catchment function, and over many years the average ADH is a distinct hydrological signature that differentiate catchments from each other. In this study, we use t-SNE, a state-of-the-art technique of dimensionality reduction, to classify 17 110 ADHs for 304 reference catchments in mountainous Western North America. t-SNE is chosen over other conventional methods of dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) as it presents greater separability of ADHs, which are projected on a 2D map where the similarities are evaluated according to their map distance. We then utilize a Deep Learning encoder to upgrade the non-parametric t-SNE to a parametric approach, enhancing its capability to address ‘unseen’ samples. Results showed that t-SNE successfully clustered ADHs of similar flow regimes on the 2D map and allowed more accurate classification with KNN. In addition, many compact clusters on the 2D map in the coastal Pacific Northwest suggest information redundancy in the local streamflow network.

The proposed algorithm first generates several feature clusters by adopting the hierarchical clustering on the feature space and then applies SVD to each of these feature clusters to find out the feature that contributes most to the SVD-entropy. The proposed feature selection method selects an optimal feature subset that not only minimizes the mutual dependency among the selected features but also maximizes the mutual dependency of the selected features against their nearest neighbor non-selected features to some extent. Each of the selected features also contributes the maximum SVD-entropy among all features of the same feature cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well against several state-of-the-art methods of feature selection in terms of various evaluation criteria such as classification accuracy, redundancy rate, and representation entropy. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) multi-omics data that consist of five datasets: gene expression, exon expression, methylation, microRNA, and pathway activity dataset (paradigm IPLs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our analysis pinpoints a candidate gene-marker, EREG for AML with an integrative omics evidence. EREG is targeted by two top ranked microRNAs, hsa-miR-1286 and hsa-miR-1976, here in the datasets.

The aim of this study was to develop a predictor-classifier during the “adenoma-carcinoma” sequence using microarray gene expression profiles of primary CRC, adenoma, and normal colon epithelial tissues. Four gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, containing 465 samples (105 normal, 155 adenoma, and 205 CRC), were preprocessed to identify differ-entially expressed genes (DEGs) between adenoma tissue and primary CRC. The feature selection procedure, using the sequential Boruta algorithm and Stepwise Regression, determined 56 highly important genes. K-Means methods showed that, using the selected 56 DEGs, the three groups were clearly separate. The classification was performed with machine learning algorithms such as Linear Model (LM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The best classification method in terms of accuracy (88.06 ± 0.70) and AUC (92.04 ± 0.47) was k-NN. To confirm the relevance of the predictive models, we applied the four models on a validation cohort: the k-NN model remained the best model in terms of performance, with 91.11% accuracy. Among the 56 DEGs, we identified 17 genes with an ascending or descending trend through the normal mucosa–adenoma–carcinoma sequence. Moreover, using the survival infor-mation of the TCGA database, we selected six DEGs related to patient prognosis (SCARA5, PKIB, CWH43, TEX11, METTL7A, and VEGFA).

Protein phosphorylation is an essential process and one of the most-studied PTMs: it occurs when a phosphate group is added to serine (Ser, S), threonine (Thr, T), or tyrosine (Tyr, Y) residue. Dysregulation of protein phosphorylation can lead to various diseases—most commonly neurological disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease—thus necessitating the prediction of S/T/Y residues that can be phosphorylated in an uncharacterized amino acid sequence. Despite a surplus of sequencing data, current experimental methods of PTM prediction are time-consuming, costly, and error-prone, so a number of computational methods have been proposed to replace them. However, phosphorylation prediction remains limited, owing to substrate specificity, performance, and the diversity of its features. Methods: In the present study we propose machine-learning-based predictors that use the physicochemical, sequence, structural, and functional information of proteins to classify S/T/Y phosphorylation sites. Rigorous feature selection, the minimum redundancy/maximum relevance approach, and the symmetrical uncertainty method were employed to extract the most informative features to train the models. Results: The RF and SVM models generated using diverse feature types in the present study were highly accurate as is evident from good values for different statistical measures. Moreover, independent test sets and benchmark validations indicated that the proposed method clearly outperformed the existing methods, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict protein phosphorylation. Conclusions: The results obtained in the present work indicate that the proposed computational methodology can be effectively used for predicting putative phosphorylation sites further facilitating discovery of various biological processes mechanisms.",MRMR | Post-translational modification | Random forest | Support vector machine | Symmetrical uncertainty,21,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,डीएसटी,,"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India"

It has been demonstrated that transforming gene expression to pathway-level information can improve the robustness and interpretability of disease grouping results. This approach, referred to as biological knowledge-driven clustering (BK-CL) approach, is often neglected, due to a lack of tools enabling systematic comparisons with more established DR-based methods. Moreover, classic clustering metrics based on group separability tend to favor the DR-CL paradigm, which may increase the risk of identifying less actionable disease subtypes that have ambiguous biological and clinical explanations. Hence, there is a need for developing metrics that assess biological and clinical relevance. To facilitate the systematic analysis of BK-CL methods, we propose a computational protocol for quantitative analysis of clustering results derived from both DR-CL and BK-CL methods. Moreover, we propose a new BK-CL method that combines prior knowledge of disease relevant genes, network diffusion algorithms and gene set enrichment analysis to generate robust pathway-level information. Benchmarking studies were conducted to compare the grouping results from different DR-CL and BK-CL approaches with respect to standard clustering evaluation metrics, concordance with known subtypes, association with clinical outcomes and disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. No single approach dominated every metric, showing the importance multi-objective evaluation in clustering analysis. However, we demonstrated that, on gene expression data sets derived from TCGA samples, the BK-CL approach can find groupings that provide significant prognostic value in both breast and prostate cancers.",cancer | clustering | multi-objective | network analysis | pathway enrichment analysis | transcriptomics,5,1,all publisherhybridgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Hybrid Gold Green,,,

When performing experiments with functional MRI datasets for classifying patients from healthy controls, we were able to obtain simpler and more generalizable DNNs. The obtained DNNs maintained a similar performance as the full network with only around 2% of the initial trainable parameters. Further, we used the trained network to identify salient brain regions and connections from functional connectome for multiple brain disorders. The identified biomarkers were found to closely correspond to previously known disease biomarkers. The proposed methods have cross-modal applications in obtaining leaner DNNs that seem to fit neuroimaging data better.

Moreover, genes picked by our algorithm improved the disease subtyping accuracy for four different cancer types over state-of-the-art methods.

However, its application against glioma is still in its infancy. In this study, the applicable candidates were excavated for mRNA vaccine treatment in the perspective of immune regulation, and suitable glioma recipients with corresponding immune subtypes were further investigated. Methods: The RNA-seq data and clinical information of 702 and 325 patients were recruited from TCGA and CGGA, separately. The genetic alteration profile was visualized and compared by cBioPortal. Then, we explored prognostic outcomes and immune correlations of the selected antigens to validate their clinical relevance. The prognostic index was measured via GEPIA2, and infiltration of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was calculated and visualized by TIMER. Based on immune-related gene expression, immune subtypes of glioma were identified using consensus clustering analysis. Moreover, the immune landscape was visualized by graph learning-based dimensionality reduction analysis. Results: Four glioma antigens, namely ANXA5, FKBP10, MSN, and PYGL, associated with superior prognoses and infiltration of APCs were selected. Three immune subtypes IS1–IS3 were identified, which fundamentally differed in molecular, cellular, and clinical signatures. Patients in subtypes IS2 and IS3 carried immunologically cold phenotypes, whereas those in IS1 carried immunologically hot phenotype. Particularly, patients in subtypes IS3 and IS2 demonstrated better outcomes than that in IS1. Expression profiles of immune checkpoints and immunogenic cell death (ICD) modulators showed a difference among IS1–IS3 tumors. Ultimately, the immune landscape of glioma elucidated considerable heterogeneity not only between individual patients but also within the same immune subtype. Conclusions: ANXA5, FKBP10, MSN, and PYGL are identified as potential antigens for anti-glioma mRNA vaccine production, specifically for patients in immune subtypes 2 and 3.

Hyperspectral image (HSI) has hundreds of contiguous narrow spectral bands from visible to infrared electromagnetic spectrum. These bands provide a wealth of information to distinguish different chemical composition of biological tissue. The reflected, fluorescent, and transmitted light from tissue captured by HSI carry quantitative diagnostic information about tissue pathology. Wealthy spectral bands also contain redundancy, which not only degrades classification performance but also increases computational complexity. Thus, dimensionality reduction (DR) needs to be conducted to reveal the essence of data by discarding redundant information. However, most of the current DR methods are based on spectral vector input (first-order representation) that ignores important correlations in the spatial domain. Although some spectral-spatial joint technologies have been investigated to overcome this disadvantage, they still consider the spectral-spatial feature into first-order data for analysis and ignore the cubic nature of hyperspectral data. Thus, a novel tensor-based Laplacian regularized sparse and low-rank graph (T-LapSLRG) for discriminant analysis is proposed to preserve the original intrinsic structure information of medical hyperspectral data and enhance the discriminant ability of features. Method: Sparse and low-rank constraints are suggested in the proposed T-LapSLRG to exploit local and global data structures while tensor analysis is developed to preserve the spatial neighborhood information. Multi-manifold is utilized to enhance the discriminant ability and describe the intrinsic geometric information. Consequently, the proposed method not only can preserve local and global structure information but also can utilize the intrinsic geometric information. Thus, it offers more discriminative power than existing tensor-based DR methods. Vector-based methods treat each pixel as an independent and identically distributed item. By contrast, the samples in T-LapSLRG are represented in the form of a third-order tensor that can preserve the original spatial neighborhood information. In addition, only a small set of the labeled training samples is needed by adopting tensor training samples. With the assumption that the samples belonging to the same class lie on a unique sub-manifold, T-LapSLRG constructs tensor-based within-class graph to characterize the within-class compactness for making the resulting graph more discriminative. In summary, T-LapSLRG jointly utilizes spatial neighborhoods and discriminative and intrinsic structure information that capture the local and global structures and the discriminative information simultaneously and make the resulting graph more robust and discriminative. Result: To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed T-LapSLRG, the medical hyperspectral data of membranous nephropathy (MN) is used. The traditional diagnosis methods of MN mainly rely on serological characteristics and renal pathological characteristics, which is tough to reach the intelligent and automated requirements of clinical diagnosis. Two types of MN are used as the experimental verification data, including primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) and hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy (HBV-MN). The microscopic hyperspectral images of PMN and HBV-MN are captured by the line scan hyperspectral imaging system SOC-710 together with the biological microscope CX31RTSF. The SOC-710 system captures 128 spectral bands with 696×520 pixels and a spectral wavelength range from 400 to 1 000 nm. The obtained medical HSI dataset consists of 30 HBV-MN images and 24 PMN images, involving 10 HBV-MN patients and 9 PMN patients. Classification is performed on the obtained low-dimensional features by the classical support vector machine classifier to evaluate the performance of the proposed T-LapSLRG. Four objective quality indices (i.e., individual class accuracy, overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and kappa coefficient (Kappa)) are used. The proposed T-LapSLRG outperforms other methods by 1.40% to 34.75% in OA, 1.46% to 36.89% in AA, and 0.031 to 0.73 in Kappa. In addition, the classification accuracy obtained by T-LapSLRG for all patients has reached more than 90%. In clinical diagnosis, the type of disease can be determined when the pixel level accuracy reaches 85% or more. Conclusion: In this study, we proposed a novel tensor-based Laplacian regularized sparse and low-rank graph for discriminant analysis. Experiments on the MN dataset demonstrate that the proposed T-LapSLRG is effective in discriminant analysis with sparse and low-rank constraints and multi-manifold, and significantly improves the classification performance.

The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a cube of voxels. Deep learning tested if texture feature map could predict diagnostic group membership of three classes under a binary classification (SCZ vs. HC, MD vs. HC, SCZ vs. MD). The method was applied in a repeated nested cross-validation scheme and cross-validated feature selection. The regions with the highest relevance (positive/negative) are presented. The method was applied on non-segmented images reducing the computation complexity and the error associated with segmentation process.",Deep learning | Depression | Layer-wise relevance propagation | MRI | Schizophrenia | Texture,23,2,all repository repositoryam,All Open Access Green,,,

The inclusion of stable allografts in mechanistic and clinical studies is vital to provide a normal, noninjured comparative group for all interrogative studies on understanding allograft injury. Objective: To refine the definition of a stable allograft as one that is clinically, histologically, and molecularly quiescent using publicly available transcriptomics data. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prognostic study, the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus was used to search for microarray gene expression data from kidney transplant tissues, resulting in 38 studies from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018. The diagnostic annotations included 510 acute rejection (AR) samples, 1154 histologically stable (hSTA) samples, and 609 normal samples. Raw fluorescence intensity data were downloaded and preprocessed followed by data set merging and batch correction. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary measure was area under the receiver operating characteristics curve from a set of feature selected genes and cell types for distinguishing AR from normal kidney tissue. Results: Within the 28 data sets, the feature selection procedure identified a set of 6 genes (KLF4, CENPJ, KLF2, PPP1R15A, FOSB, TNFAIP3) (area under the curve [AUC], 0.98) and 5 immune cell types (CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cell central memory [Tcm], CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cell effector memory [Tem], CD8<sup>+</sup>Tem, natural killer [NK] cells, and Type 1 T helper [T<inf>H</inf>1] cells) (AUC, 0.92) that were combined into 1 composite Instability Score (InstaScore) (AUC, 0.99). The InstaScore was applied to the hSTA samples: 626 of 1154 (54%) were found to be immune quiescent and redefined as histologically and molecularly stable (hSTA/mSTA); 528 of 1154 (46%) were found to have molecular evidence of rejection (hSTA/mAR) and should not have been classified as stable allografts. The validation on an independent cohort of 6 months of protocol biopsy samples in December 2019 showed that hSTA/mAR samples had a significant change in graft function (r = 0.52, P <.001) and graft loss at 5-year follow-up (r = 0.17). A drop by 10 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>in estimated glomerular filtration rate was estimated as a threshold in allograft transitioning from hSTA/mSTA to hSTA/mAR. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this prognostic study suggest that the InstaScore could provide an important adjunct for comprehensive and highly quantitative phenotyping of protocol kidney transplant biopsy samples and could be integrated into clinical care for accurate estimation of subsequent patient clinical outcomes..",,9,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

A popular criteria for feature selection is Mutual Information (MI) as it can capture both the linear and non-linear relationship among different features and class variable. Existing MI based feature selection methods use different approximation techniques to capture the joint performance of features, their relationship with the classes and eliminate the redundant features. However, these approximations may fail to select the optimal set of features, especially when the feature dimension is high. Besides, due to the absence of an appropriate searching strategy, these MI based approximations may select unnecessary features. To address these issues, we propose a method namely Feature Selection based on Redundancy maximized Clusters (FSRC) that creates the clusters of redundant features and then selects a subset of representative features from each cluster. We also propose to use bias corrected normalized MI in this regard. Rigorous experiments performed on thirty benchmark datasets demonstrate that FSRC outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in most of the cases. Moreover, FSRC is applied to three gene expression datasets which are high-dimensional but small sample datasets. The result shows that FSRC can select the features (genes) that are not only discriminating but also biologically relevant.",Bias correction | Clustering | Feature selection | Normalized mutual information,4,0,,,,,

Integrating multi-omics data serves multiple purposes, such as, an integrated data model, dimensionality reduction of omic features, patient clustering, etc. For oncological data, patient clustering is synonymous to cancer subtype prediction. However, there is a gap in combining some of the widely used integrative analyses to build more powerful tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a multi-level integration algorithm to identify representative integrative subspace and use it for cancer subtype prediction. The three integrative approaches we implement on multi-omics features are, (1) multivariate multiple (linear) regression of the features from a cohort of patients/samples, (2) network construction using different omics features, and (3) fusion of sample similarity networks across the features. We use a type of multilayer network, called heterogeneous network, as a data model to transition between a network-free (NF) regression model and a network-based (NB) model, which uses correlation networks. The heterogeneous networks consist of intra- and inter-layer graphs. Our proposed heterogeneous correlation network model, HCNM, is central to our algorithm for gene-ranking, integrative subspace identification, and tumor-specific subtypes prediction. The genes of our representative integrative subspace have been enriched with gene-ontology and found to exhibit significant gene-disease association (GDA) scores. The subspace in genes which is less than 5% of the total gene-set of each genomic feature is used with NB fusion integrative model to predict sample subtypes. As the identified integrative subspace data of multi-omics is less prone to noise, bias, and outliers, our experiments show that the subtypes in our results agree with previous benchmark studies and exhibit better classification between poor and good survival of patient cohorts.Clinical relevance: Finding significant cancer-specific genes and subtypes of cancer is vital for early prognosis, and personalized treatment; therefore, improves survival probability of a patient.",,7,0,,,Meity,,Ministry of Electronics and Information technology

The developed approach has two main objectives, consisting of relevance maximization and redundancy minimization of the selected genes. In this method, in each iteration, one subgraph is extracted, and then among the existing genes in this cluster, appropriate genes are selected using filter-based measure.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have no pathogenic symptoms, i.e., presymptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients. Both patients could further spread the virus to other susceptible people, thereby making the control of COVID-19 difficult. The two major challenges for COVID-19 diagnosis at present are as follows: (1) patients could share similar symptoms with other respiratory infections, and (2) patients may not have any symptoms but could still spread the virus. Therefore, new biomarkers at different omics levels are required for the large-scale screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. Although some initial analyses could identify a group of candidate gene biomarkers for COVID-19, the previous work still could not identify biomarkers capable for clinical use in COVID-19, which requires disease-specific diagnosis compared with other multiple infectious diseases. As an extension of the previous study, optimized machine learning models were applied in the present study to identify some specific qualitative host biomarkers associated with COVID-19 infection on the basis of a publicly released transcriptomic dataset, which included healthy controls and patients with bacterial infection, influenza, COVID-19, and other kinds of coronavirus. This dataset was first analysed by Boruta, Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy feature selection methods one by one, resulting in a feature list. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection method, incorporating one of the classification algorithms to extract essential biomarkers and build efficient classifiers and classification rules.

Microarrays have become crucial to identifying genes involved in causing these changes; however, microarray data analysis is challenged by the high-dimensionality of data compared to the number of samples. This has contributed to inconsistent cancer biomarkers from various gene expression studies. Also, identification of crucial genes in cancer can be expedited through expression profiling of peripheral blood cells. We introduce a novel feature selection method for microarrays involving a two-step filtering process to select a minimum set of genes with greater consistency and relevance, and demonstrate that the selected gene set considerably enhances the diagnostic accuracy of cancer. The preliminary filtering (Bi-biological filter) involves building gene coexpression networks for cancer and healthy conditions using a topological overlap matrix (TOM) and finding cancer specific gene clusters using Spectral Clustering (SC). This is followed by a filtering step to extract a much-reduced set of crucial genes using best first search with support vector machine (BFS-SVM). Finally, artificial neural networks, SVM, and K-nearest neighbor classifiers are used to assess the predictive power of the selected genes as well as to select the most effective diagnostic system. The approach was applied to peripheral blood profiling for breast cancer where Bi-biological filter selected 415 biologically consistent genes, from which BFS-SVM extracted 13 highly cancer specific genes for breast cancer identification. ANN was the superior classifier with 93.2% classification accuracy, a 14% improvement over the study from which data were obtained for this study (Aaroe et al., Breast Cancer Res 12:R7, 2010).",Bioinformatics | Blood mRNA | Breast cancer | Computer-aided diagnosis | Data mining | Feature selection | Gene expression | Spectral clustering | Topological overlap,6,0,,,,,Lincoln University

Within a specific run, eighteen of the features selected by TCox are also selected by the other survival regression models tested, therefore undoubtedly being crucial players in the survival of colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, the TCox model exclusively selects genes able to categorize patients into significant risk groups. Our work demonstrates the ability of the proposed weighted regularizer TCox to disclose novel molecular drivers in CRC survival by accounting for correlation-based network information from both tumor and normal tissue. The results presented support the relevance of network information for biomarker identification in high-dimensional gene expression data and foster new directions for the development of network-based feature selection methods in precision oncology.",Cox regression | Regularized optimization | RNA-seq data | Survival analysis | TCGA data,3,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,COST,DSAIPA/DS/0026/2019,European Cooperation in Science and Technology

Tumor profiles can be characterized by tens of thousands of gene expression features. Due to the size of the gene expression feature set machine learning methods are exposed to noisy variables and complexity. Tumor types present heterogeneity and can be subdivided in tumor subtypes. In many cases tumor data does not include tumor subtype labeling thus unsupervised learning methods are necessary for tumor subtype discovery. This work aims to learn meaningful and low dimensional representations of tumor samples and find tumor subtype clusters while keeping biological signatures without using tumor labels. By using Autoencoders a low dimensional and denoised latent space is learned as a target representation to guide a Multiple Kernel Learning model that selects a subset of genes. By using the selected genes a clustering method is used to group samples. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed unsupervised feature selection method the obtained features and clusters are analyzed by clinical significance. The proposed method has been applied on three tumor datasets which are Brain, Renal and Lung, each one composed by two tumor subtypes. The results obtained by the proposed method reveal lower redundancy in the selected features and each obtained cluster is significantly enriched by just one tumor subtype when compared with benchmark unsupervised feature selection methods. The proposed method named Latent Kernel Feature Selection (LKFS) is an unsupervised approach for gene selection in tumor gene expression profiles.",Autoencoders | Gene Expression | Kernel Methods | Unsupervised Feature Selection,2,2,all repository repositoryam,All Open Access Green,CONICET,,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

Methods: A total of 573 primary early stage NSCLC patients who underwent SBRT between January 2006 and March 2016 and met the eligibility criteria were included in this study. Patients were divided into two datasets: training (464 patients in 10 institutions) and test (109 patients in one institution) datasets. A total of 944 radiomic features were extracted from manually segmented gross tumor volumes (GTVs). Feature selection was performed by analyzing inter-segmentation reproducibility, GTV correlation, and inter-feature redundancy. Nine clinical factors, including histology and GTV size, were also used. Three prognostic models (clinical, radiomic, and combined) for LR and DM were constructed using random survival forest (RSF) to deal with total death as a competing risk in the training dataset. Robust models with optimal hyper-parameters were determined using fivefold cross-validation. The patients were dichotomized into two groups based on the median value of the patient-specific risk scores (high- and low-risk score groups). Gray's test was used to evaluate the statistical significance between the two risk score groups. The prognostic power was evaluated by the concordance index with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) via bootstrapping (2000 iterations). Results: The concordance indices at 3 yr of clinical, radiomic, and combined models for LR were 0.57 [CI: 0.39–0.75], 0.55 [CI: 0.38–0.73], and 0.61 [CI: 0.43–0.78], respectively, whereas those for DM were 0.59 [CI: 0.54–0.79], 0.67 [CI: 0.54–0.79], and 0.68 [CI: 0.55–0.81], respectively, in the test dataset. The combined DM model significantly discriminated its cumulative incidence between high- and low-risk score groups (P < 0.05). The variable importance of RSF in the combined model for DM indicated that two radiomic features were more important than other clinical factors. The feature maps generated on the basis of the most important radiomic feature had visual difference between high- and low-risk score groups. Conclusions: The radiomics approach with RSF for competing risks using breath-hold CT-based radiomic features might predict DM in early stage NSCLC patients who underwent SBRT although that may not have potential to predict LR.",distant metastasis | NSCLC | radiomics | random survival forest | SBRT,36,1,all publisherfree2read,All Open Access Bronze,KAKEN,16H05389,Takeda Science Foundation

Such analysis often provides a wide list of genes that are differentially expressed between two or more groups.

Furthermore, DEGs are treated as candidate biomarkers and a small set of DEGs might be identified as biomarkers using either biological knowledge or data-driven approaches. Methods: In this work, we present a novel approach for identifying biomarkers from a list of DEGs by re-ranking them according to the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) criteria using repeated cross-validation feature selection procedure. Results: Using gene expression profiles for 199 children with sepsis and septic shock, we identify 108 DEGs and propose a 10-gene signature for reliably predicting pediatric sepsis mortality with an estimated Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) score of 0.89. Conclusions: Machine learning based refinement of DE analysis is a promising tool for prioritizing DEGs and discovering biomarkers from gene expression profiles.

Unsupervised problems are of particular relevance, as the generation of labels for the data is often labor-intensive, expensive or simply not possible. However, interpretability of the data and the results is key to extract new valuable knowledge from the large-scale datasets that are studied. This highlights the necessity of adequate unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques that can lower the computational workload necessary to process the dataset, while at the same time providing information on its structure. This paper describes a framework that brings together previous proposals on unsupervised feature clustering, with the goal of providing a scalable, interpretable and robust dimensionality reduction on single-cell imaging data. The framework integrates several inter-feature dissimilarity measures, clustering algorithms, quality criteria to select the best feature clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods that are built on the clustering. For each of these components, several approaches proposed in previous works have been tested and evaluated on three use cases coming from two different imaging datasets, highlighting the best-performing components. Affinity clustering is applied for feature clustering for the first time. The results were validated using statistical tests, showing that many of the combinations tested lowered the complexity of the datasets while maintaining or improving the accuracy yielded by classifiers applied on them. The analysis highlighted affinity clustering as the best algorithm for feature clustering, with median differences of up to 8.9% and 0.9% in accuracy with respect to FSFS and hierarchical clustering. Representation entropy obtained a median difference of 13.0% and 0.8% with respect to class separability and silhouette index, respectively, as a robust unsupervised criterion to select the cluster set. Dissimilarities based on Pearson's correlation performed slightly better than the alternatives, with a median improvement of 2.8% with respect to the cosine distance.",Feature clustering | Feature selection | Imaging data | Single-cell data | Unsupervised dimensionality reduction,25,0,,,,170303/12X1619N,KU Leuven

The common imaging signs (CISs) which appear in the patient’s lung CT scan play a significant role in the identification of cancerous lung nodules and many other lung diseases. In this paper, we propose a new combination of descriptors for the effective retrieval of these imaging signs. First, we construct a feature database by combining local ternary pattern (LTP), local phase quantization (LPQ), and discrete wavelet transform. Next, joint mutual information (JMI)–based feature selection is deployed to reduce the redundancy and to select an optimal feature set for CISs retrieval. To this end, similarity measurement is performed by combining visual and semantic information in equal proportion to construct a balanced graph and the shortest path is computed for learning contextual similarity to obtain final similarity between each query and database image. The proposed system is evaluated on a publicly available database of lung CT imaging signs (LISS), and results are retrieved based on visual feature similarity comparison and graph-based similarity comparison. The proposed system achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of 60% and 0.48 AUC of precision-recall (P-R) graph using only visual features similarity comparison.

Hence, the feature selection technique is widely applied. Many feature selection methods measure features based on relevance, redundancy and complementarity. Feature complementarity means that two features’ cooperation can provide more information than the simple summation of their individual information. In this paper, we studied the feature selection technique and proposed a new feature selection algorithm based on relevance, redundancy and complementarity (FS-RRC). On selecting the feature subset, FS-RRC not only evaluates the feature relevance with the class label and the redundancy among the features but also evaluates the feature complementarity. If complementary features exist for a selected relevant feature, FS-RRC retains the feature with the largest complementarity to the selected feature subset. To show the performance of FS-RRC, it was compared with eleven efficient feature selection methods, MIFS, mRMR, CMIM, ReliefF, FCBF, PGVNS, MCRMCR, MCRMICR, RCDFS, SAFE and SVM-RFE on two synthetic datasets and fifteen public biological datasets. The experimental results showed the superiority of FS-RRC in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, stability and time complexity. Hence, integrating feature individual discriminative ability, redundancy and complementarity can define more powerful feature subset for biological data analysis, and feature complementarity can help to study the biomedical phenomena more accurately.",Biological data analysis | Feature complementarity | Feature redundancy | Feature relevance | Feature selection,46,0,,,,,

The far-reaching development technologies such as biological sequencing at single cell level make feature selection a more challenging work. The difficulty lies in four facts: Those features measured are in high dimension and with noise; dropouts make the data much sparse; many features are either redundant or irrelevant; and samples are not well-labeled in the experiments. Here, we propose a new model called ELF (Extract Landmark Features) to address the above challenges. ELF aims to simultaneously maximize topology maintenance to keep the pairwise relationships among samples, minimize feature redundancy to diversify the features, and maximize feature specificity to make every selected feature more representative. This makes ELF a nonlinear combinatorial optimization. To solve this difficult problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on greedy strategy. We show ELF's outstanding performance on two single cell RNA-seq datasets. One is the direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuron and the other is hepatoblast differentiation. ELF is able to choose only hundreds of landmark genes to maintain the cells' correlativity. Topology maintenance, redundancy removal, and specificity each plays its important role in selecting landmark features and revealing cells' biological functions. In addition, ELF can be generally applied in other scenarios. We demonstrate that ELF can reveal pivotal pixel in writing region and human face in two public image datasets. We believe that ELF is a useful tool to obtain more interpretable results by revealing key features while clustering the samples well.",Feature selection | optimization | single cell | topology maintenance,2,0,,,NSFC,11661141019,National Natural Science Foundation of China

By participating in binding interactions with proteins, glycans often play key roles in host-pathogen interactions. The specificities of glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins and antibodies, are governed by motifs within larger glycan structures, and improved characterisations of these determinants would aid research into human diseases. Identification of motifs has previously been approached as a frequent subtree mining problem, and we extend these approaches with a glycan notation that allows recognition of terminal motifs. Results: In this work, we customised a frequent subtree mining approach by altering the glycan notation to include information on terminal connections. This allows specific identification of terminal residues as potential motifs, better capturing the complexity of glycan-binding interactions. We achieved this by including additional nodes in a graph representation of the glycan structure to indicate the presence or absence of a linkage at particular backbone carbon positions. Combining this frequent subtree mining approach with a state-of-the-art feature selection algorithm termed minimum-redundancy, maximum-relevance (mRMR), we have generated a classification pipeline that is trained on data from a glycan microarray. When applied to a set of commonly used lectins, the identified motifs were consistent with known binding determinants. Furthermore, logistic regression classifiers trained using these motifs performed well across most lectins examined, with a median AUC value of 0.89. Conclusions: We present here a new subtree mining approach for the classification of glycan binding and identification of potential binding motifs. The Carbohydrate Classification Accounting for Restricted Linkages (CCARL) method will assist in the interpretation of glycan microarray experiments and will aid in the discovery of novel binding motifs for further experimental characterisation.",Carbohydrate | Frequent subtree mining | Glycan | Glycobiology | Machine learning | Microarray | Motif,25,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,RMIT,,RMIT University

Here, we divided the sample set based on the genome-wide methylation distance to make full use of metastatic cancer data. Specifically, we implemented two differential methylation analysis methods to identify specific CpG sites. After effective dimensionality reduction, we constructed a methylation-based classifier using the Random Forest algorithm to categorize the primary breast cancer. We took advantage of breast cancer (BRCA) HM450 DNA methylation data and accompanying clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to validate the performance of the classifier. Overall, this study demonstrates DNA methylation as a potential biomarker to predict breast tumor invasiveness and as a possible parameter that could be included in the studies aiming to predict breast cancer aggressiveness.

There is an urgent need to find circulating prognostic molecules and liquid biopsy methods for breast cancer diagnosis and reducing the mortality rate. In this study, we systematically evaluated metabolites and proteins in blood to develop a pipeline to identify potential circulating biomarkers for breast cancer risk. Our aim is to identify a group of molecules to be used in the design of portable and low-cost biomarker detection devices. We obtained plasma samples from women who are cancer free (healthy) and women who were cancer free at the time of blood collection but developed breast cancer later (susceptible). We extracted potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer risk from plasma metabolomics and proteomics data using statistical and discriminative power analyses. We pre-processed the data to ensure the quality of subsequent analyses, and used two main feature selection methods to determine the importance of each molecule. After further feature elimination based on pairwise dependencies, we measured the performance of logistic regression classifier on the remaining molecules and compared their biological relevance. We identified six signatures that predicted breast cancer risk with different specificity and selectivity. The best performing signature had 13 factors. We validated the difference in level of one of the biomarkers, SCF/KITLG, in plasma from healthy and susceptible individuals.

In this paper, a novel graph-based sparse feature selection method is proposed that take into account both issues: relevancy and redundancy analysis. An empirical loss function joining with ℓ<inf>1</inf>-norm regularization term is proposed to overcome the relevancy issue and the redundancy issue is overcome by introducing a regularization term that prefers uncorrelated features. Furthermore, the proposed learning procedure is guided by two different sets of supervision information as pairs of must-linked (positive) and cannot-linked (negative) constraint sets to select a discriminative feature subset. These guiding information besides the whole data points are encoded in the graph Laplacian matrix that preserves the locality structure of the original data. The graph Laplacian matrix is constructed by two different approaches. Our first approach tries to preserve the structure of the original data guided just by the positive data points (unique samples in the must-linked constraints), and our second approach applies a normalized adapted affinity matrix to embed the pairwise must-linked and cannot-linked constraints as well as the neighborhood relationships information, all together. The experimental results on a number of several datasets from the University of California-Irvine machine learning repository, in addition to several high dimensional gene expression datasets show the efficacy of the proposed methods in the classification tasks compared to several powerful feature selection methods.",Graph Laplacian | Locality structure preserving | Pairwise constraints | Pairwise redundancy | Sparse feature selection | ℓ1-norm,14,0,,,,,

The purpose of this pilot study was twofold: (1) to characterize changes in CBCT-based radiomics features during treatment; and (2) to quantify the potential association of CBCT-based delta-radiomics features with overall survival in locally advanced lung cancer. We retrospectively identified 23 patients and calculated 658 radiomics features from each of 11 CBCT images per patient. Feature selection was performed based on repeatability, robustness against contouring uncertainties, and non-redundancy. We calculated the coefficient of determination (R <sup>2</sup>) for the relationship between the actual feature value at the end of treatment and predicted value based on linear models fitted using features between the first and kth fractions. We also quantified the predictive ability for survival with two methods by: (1) comparing delta-radiomics features (defined as the mean change between the first and kth fractions) between two groups of patients divided by a cutoff survival time of 18 months using the t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test; and (2) quantifying univariate discrimination of two groups divided by the median of delta-radiomics feature. All selected seven radiomics features during treatment (as early as the 10th fraction) were predictive of those at the end of treatment (R <sup>2</sup> > 0.64). Three delta-radiomics features demonstrated significant differences (q < 0.05, as early as the 10th fraction) between the two groups of patients divided by the cutoff survival time. Two of those three features were also predictive of survival according to the log-rank statistics. We provided the first demonstration of a potential association of CBCT-based delta-radiomics features early during treatment with overall survival in locally advanced lung cancer.

The improved clustering of microarray data has had a particularly strong impact in the fields of genomics and medicine. However, when we bring several ensemble members together to form a consensus, low-quality data partitions can seriously compromise the final solution. One way to overcome this problem is the weighted cluster ensemble approach based on Partition Relevance Analysis (PRA), which uses internal cluster validity indices to evaluate and weight the ensemble members before the fusion. Unfortunately, the selection of appropriate validation indices for given data is far from trivial. In this paper, we propose an additional step in PRA that reduces the size of the committee of cluster validation indices. It does so by eliminating redundant and noisy indices using data dimensionality reduction methods. Our extension works in an unsupervised way, minimizing the amount of user intervention and required expert knowledge. We adapted three conventional consensus functions based on the principle of evidence accumulation to work with PRA weights. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed reduction step of PRA based on extensive experiments with 25 gene expression and 15 non-genetic real-world datasets, where we compared 15 consensus functions.

In this work, an ensemble predictor named iRNA-m6A was established to identify m6A sites in multiple tissues of human, mouse and rat based on the data from high-throughput sequencing techniques. In the proposed predictor, RNA sequences were encoded by physical-chemical property matrix, mono-nucleotide binary encoding and nucleotide chemical property.

To enhance the capability of both exploitation and exploration, matrix-based search parameters and dispersing mechanisms are incorporated into the two proposed FA models. We first replace the attractiveness coefficient with a randomized control matrix in the IIEFA model to release the FA from the constraints of biological law, as the exploitation capability in the neighbourhood is elevated from a one-dimensional to multi-dimensional search mechanism with enhanced diversity in search scopes, scales, and directions. Besides that, we employ a dispersing mechanism in the second CIEFA model to dispatch fireflies with high similarities to new positions out of the close neighbourhood to perform global exploration. This dispersing mechanism ensures sufficient variance between fireflies in comparison to increase search efficiency. The ALL-IDB2 database, a skin lesion data set, and a total of 15 UCI data sets are employed to evaluate efficiency of the proposed FA models on clustering tasks. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR)-based feature selection method is also adopted to reduce feature dimensionality.

Its increasing availability provides opportunities to identify cell populations from single-cell RNA-seq data. Computational methods have been employed to reveal the gene expression variations among multiple cell populations. Unfortunately, the existing ones can suffer from realistic restrictions such as experimental noises, numerical instability, high dimensionality and computational scalability. Results: We propose an evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning algorithm (EMEP) that addresses those realistic restrictions. Our EMEP algorithm first applies the unsupervised dimensionality reduction to project data from the original high dimensions to low-dimensional subspaces; basic clustering algorithms are applied in those new subspaces to generate different clustering results to form cluster ensembles. However, most of those cluster ensembles are unnecessarily bulky with the expense of extra time costs and memory consumption. To overcome that problem, EMEP is designed to dynamically select the suitable clustering results from the ensembles. Moreover, to guide the multiobjective ensemble evolution, three cluster validity indices including the overall cluster deviation, the within-cluster compactness and the number of basic partition clusters are formulated as the objective functions to unleash its cell type discovery performance using evolutionary multiobjective optimization. We applied EMEP to 55 simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including six single-cell RNA-seq dataset and one large-scale dataset with 3005 cells and 4412 genes. Two case studies are also conducted to reveal mechanistic insights into the biological relevance of EMEP.

In this paper, we proposed a novel computational method named Ensemble of Decision Tree based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (EDTMDA), which innovatively built a computational framework integrating ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction. For each miRNA-disease pair, the feature vector was extracted by calculating the statistical measures, graph theoretical measures, and matrix factorization results for the miRNA and disease, respectively. Then multiple base learnings were built to yield many decision trees (DTs) based on random selection of negative samples and miRNA/disease features. Particularly, Principal Components Analysis was applied to each base learning to reduce feature dimensionality and hence remove the noise or redundancy. Average strategy was adopted for these DTs to get final association scores between miRNAs and diseases. In model performance evaluation, EDTMDA showed AUC of 0.9309 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and AUC of 0.8524 in local LOOCV. Additionally, AUC of 0.9192+/-0.0009 in 5-fold cross validation proved the model’s reliability and stability. Furthermore, three types of case studies for four human diseases were implemented.

The second module aims to solve the problem caused by imbalanced data using hybrid sampling algorithm RUSBoost. The third module focuses on the classification algorithm optimization. We use mixed kernel function (MKF) based support vector machine (SVM) model to classify an unknown sample into healthy individuals and CRC patients, and then, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is applied to find most optimal parameters of the proposed MKF-SVM. The final results show that the proposed model achieves higher G-means than other comparable models. The conclusion comes to show that RUSBoost wrapping WOA + MKF-SVM model can be applied to improve the predictive performance of colorectal cancer based on the imbalanced data.",Colorectal cancer | Feature selection | Mixed kernel function | Support vector machine | Whale optimization algorithm,18,1,,,NSFC,TSHW201502038,Department of Science and Technology of Shandong Province

Due to functional redundancies and multiple layers of regulation in complex biologic systems, individual biomarkers, while useful, are inherently limited in disease characterization. Data reduction and discriminant analysis tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), or orthogonal PLS (O-PLS) provide approaches to separate the metabolic phenotypes, but do not offer a statistical basis for selection of group-wise metabolites as contributors to metabolic phenotypes. Methods: We present a dimensionality-reduction based approach termed 'biplot correlation range (BCR)' that uses biplot correlation analysis with direct orthogonal signal correction and PLS to provide the group-wise selection of metabolic markers contributing to metabolic phenotypes. Results: Using a simulated multiple-layer system that often arises in complex biologic systems, we show the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach in comparison of existing approaches based on false discovery rate and correlation. To demonstrate the proposed method in a real-life dataset, we used LC-MS based metabolomics to determine spectrum of metabolites present in liver mitochondria from wild-type (WT) mice and thioredoxin-2 transgenic (TG) mice. We select discriminatory variables in terms of increased score in the direction of class identity using BCR. The results show that BCR provides means to identify metabolites contributing to class separation in a manner that a statistical method by false discovery rate or statistical total correlation spectroscopy can hardly find in complex data analysis for predictive health and personalized medicine.",Biplot correlation | Feature selection | Metabolomics,5,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,NIH,AG038746,National Institutes of Health

Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to deal with this challenging problem. However, most of them mainly focus on secondary structure information of pre-microRNAs, while ignoring sequence-order information and sequence evolution information. Results: We use new features for the machine learning algorithms to improve the classification performance by characterizing both sequence order evolution information and secondary structure graphs. We developed three steps to extract these features of pre-microRNAs. We first extract features from PSI-BLAST profiles and Hilbert-Huang transforms, which contain rich sequence evolution information and sequence-order information respectively. We then obtain properties of small molecular networks of pre-microRNAs, which contain refined secondary structure information. These structural features are carefully generated so that they can depict both global and local characteristics of pre-microRNAs. In total, our feature space covers 591 features. The maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR) feature selection method is adopted before support vector machine (SVM) is applied as our classifier. The constructed classification model is named MicroRNA -NHPred. The performance of MicroRNA -NHPred is high and stable, which is better than that of those state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy of up to 94.83% on same benchmark datasets. Conclusions: The high prediction accuracy achieved by our proposed method is attributed to the design of a comprehensive feature set on the sequences and secondary structures, which are capable of characterizing the sequence evolution information and sequence-order information, and global and local information of pre-microRNAs secondary structures.

To further improve the classification performance of microarray data, a gene selection approach based on the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) is proposed. First, the FLD method is employed to reduce the preliminarily genetic data to obtain features with a strong classification ability, which can form a candidate gene subset.

At the same time there can be a large number of physiological characteristics, many of which may be redundant or irrelevant. In existing human physiological feature selection algorithms, it is difficult to overcome the impact that redundancy and irrelevancy may have on human body composition modeling. This suggests a role for selection algorithms, where human physiological characteristics are identified using a combination of filtering and improved clustering. To do this, a feature filtering method based on Hilbert- Schmidt dependency criteria is first of all used to eliminate irrelevant features. After this, it is possible to use improved Chameleon clustering to increase the combination of sub-clusters amongst the characteristics, thereby removing any redundant features to obtain a candidate feature set for human body composition modeling. Method We report here on the use of an algorithm to filter the characteristic parameters in INBODY770 (this paper used INBODY 770 as body composition analyzer.) measurement data, which has three commonly-used impedance bands (1 kHZ, 250 kHZ, 500 kHZ). This algorithm is able to filter out parameters that have a low correlation with body composition BFM. The algorithm is also able to draw upon improved clustering techniques to reduce the initial feature set from 29 parameters to 10 parameters for any parameters of the 250 kHZ band that remain after filtering. In addition, we also examined the impact of different sample sizes on feature selection. Result The proposed algorithm is able to remove irrelevant and redundant features and the resulting correlation between the model and the body composition (BFM which is a whole body fat evaluation can better assess the body's overall fat and muscle composition.) is 0.978, thereby providing an improved model for prediction with a relative error of less than 0.12.",,3,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryvor repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

To get good classification performance, it is necessary to preprocess the gene expression data. Support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) is a classical method for gene selection. However, SVM-RFE suffers from high computational complexity. To remedy it, this paper enhances SVM-RFE for gene selection by incorporating feature clustering, called feature clustering SVM-RFE (FCSVM-RFE). The proposed method first performs gene selection roughly and then ranks the selected genes. First, a clustering algorithm is used to cluster genes into gene groups, in each which genes have similar expression profile. Then, a representative gene is found to represent a gene group. By doing so, we can obtain a representative gene set. Then, SVM-RFE is applied to rank these representative genes. FCSVM-RFE can reduce the computational complexity and the redundancy among genes.

Survival of patients with metastatic melanoma varies widely, and response rates to treatment range from 20-40% with combination therapy, and frequently there is no observed improvement in overall survival. Many of the available therapies have targeted the BRAFV600E mutation, which gives rise to increased cell proliferation through constitutive activation of the regulatory MAPK pathway. These drugs have not proven successful for all patients with tumors expressing these mutations, therefore identifying other key genes influencing response and survival is important. In this paper, we utilize data from 62 skin tumor cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) to examine features of gene expression (> 19, 000) and DNA copy number variation (> 20, 000) to assess the existence of clusters and, if so, the features which give rise to those clusters.

Microarray analysis allows the examination of levels of gene expression in specific cell samples, where thousands of genes can be analyzed simultaneously. However, microarray data have very little sample data and high data dimensionality. Therefore, to classify microarray data, a dimensional reduction process is required. Dimensional reduction can eliminate redundancy of data; thus, features used in classification are features that only have a high correlation with their class. There are two types of dimensional reduction, namely feature selection and feature extraction. In this paper, we used k-means algorithm as the clustering approach for feature selection. The proposed approach can be used to categorize features that have the same characteristics in one cluster, so that redundancy in microarray data is removed. The result of clustering is ranked using the Relief algorithm such that the best scoring element for each cluster is obtained.

These lists of genes are often called genomic signatures and their linkage to phenotype associations may form a significant step in discovering the causation between genotypes and phenotypes. Traditional methods that produce genomic signatures from DNA Microarray data tend to extract significantly different lists under relatively small variations of the training data. That instability hinders the validity of research findings and raises skepticism about the reliability of such methods. In this study, a complete framework for the extraction of stable and reliable lists of candidate genes is presented. The proposed methodology enforces stability of results at the validation step and as a result, it is independent of the feature selection and classification methods used. Furthermore, two different statistical tests are performed in order to assess the statistical significance of the observed results. Moreover, the consistency of the signatures extracted by independent executions of the proposed method is also evaluated.

Across signal and imaging modalities, a large number of features have been proposed, leading to feature redundancy and the need for optimal feature set identification. A further complication is that, due to the inherent biological variability, even the same classification problem on different datasets can display variations in the respective optimal sets, casting doubts on the generalizability of relevant features. Here, we approach this problem by leveraging topological tools to create charts of features spaces. These charts highlight feature sub-groups that encode similar information (and their respective similarities) allowing for a principled and interpretable choice of features for classification and analysis. Using multiple electromyographic (EMG) datasets as a case study, we use this feature chart to identify functional groups among 58 state-of-the-art EMG features, and to show that they generalize across three different forearm EMG datasets obtained from able-bodied subjects during hand and finger contractions. We find that these groups describe meaningful non-redundant information, succinctly recapitulating information about different regions of feature space.

Most GBMs exhibit extensive regional heterogeneity at tissue, cellular, and molecular scales, but the clinical relevance of the observed spatial imaging characteristics remains unknown. We investigated pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of GBMs to identify tumor subregions and quantify their image-based spatial characteristics that are associated with survival time. Materials and Methods: We quantified tumor subregions (termed habitats) in GBMs, which are hypothesized to capture intratumoral characteristics using multiple MRI sequences. For proof-of-concept, we developed a computational framework that used intratumoral grouping and spatial mapping to identify GBM tumor subregions and yield habitat-based features. Using a feature selector and three classifiers, experimental results from two datasets are reported, including Dataset1 with 32 GBM patients (594 tumor slices) and Dataset2 with 22 GBM patients, who did not undergo resection (261 tumor slices) for survival group prediction. Results: In both datasets, we show that habitat-based features achieved 87.50% and 86.36% accuracies for survival group prediction, respectively, using leave-one-out cross-validation. Experimental results revealed that spatially correlated features between signal-enhanced subregions were effective for predicting survival groups (P < 0.05 for all three machine-learning classifiers). Conclusion: The quantitative spatial-correlated features derived from MRI-defined tumor subregions in GBM could be effectively used to predict the survival time of patients. Level of Evidence: 2. J.

Single gene or gene-set biomarkers are inadequate to provide sufficient understanding of complex disease mechanisms and the relationship among those genes. Network-based methods have thus been considered for inferring the interaction within a group of genes to further study the disease mechanism. Recently, the Gene-Network-based Feature Set (GNFS), which is capable of handling case-control and multiclass expression for gene biomarker identification, has been proposed, partly taking into account of network topology. However, its performance relies on a greedy search for building subnetworks and thus requires further improvement. In this work, we establish a new approach named Gene Sub-Network-based Feature Selection (GSNFS) by implementing the GNFS framework with two proposed searching and scoring algorithms, namely gene-set-based (GS) search and parent-node-based (PN) search, to identify subnetworks. An additional dataset is used to validate the results. Methods: The two proposed searching algorithms of the GSNFS method for subnetwork expansion are concerned with the degree of connectivity and the scoring scheme for building subnetworks and their topology. For each iteration of expansion, the neighbour genes of a current subnetwork, whose expression data improved the overall subnetwork score, is recruited. While the GS search calculated the subnetwork score using an activity score of a current subnetwork and the gene expression values of its neighbours, the PN search uses the expression value of the corresponding parent of each neighbour gene. Four lung cancer expression datasets were used for subnetwork identification. In addition, using pathway data and protein-protein interaction as network data in order to consider the interaction among significant genes were discussed. Classification was performed to compare the performance of the identified gene subnetworks with three subnetwork identification algorithms. Results: The two searching algorithms resulted in better classification and gene/gene-set agreement compared to the original greedy search of the GNFS method. The identified lung cancer subnetwork using the proposed searching algorithm resulted in an improvement of the cross-dataset validation and an increase in the consistency of findings between two independent datasets. The homogeneity measurement of the datasets was conducted to assess dataset compatibility in cross-dataset validation. The lung cancer dataset with higher homogeneity showed a better result when using the GS search while the dataset with low homogeneity showed a better result when using the PN search. The 10-fold cross-dataset validation on the independent lung cancer datasets showed higher classification performance of the proposed algorithms when compared with the greedy search in the original GNFS method. Conclusions: The proposed searching algorithms provide a higher number of genes in the subnetwork expansion step than the greedy algorithm. As a result, the performance of the subnetworks identified from the GSNFS method was improved in terms of classification performance and gene/gene-set level agreement depending on the homogeneity of the datasets used in the analysis. Some common genes obtained from the four datasets using different searching algorithms are genes known to play a role in lung cancer. The improvement of classification performance and the gene/gene-set level agreement, and the biological relevance indicated the effectiveness of the GSNFS method for gene subnetwork identification using expression data.",,16,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,KMUTT,,King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi

It has been used for feature selection from microarray gene expression data in many works. One of the merits of MI is that, unlike many other heuristic methods, it is based on a mature theoretic foundation. When applied to microarray data, however, it faces some challenges. First, due to the large number of features (i.e., genes) present in microarray data, the true distributions for the expression values of some genes may be distorted by noise. Second, evaluating inter-group mutual information requires estimating multi-variate distributions, which is quite difficult if not impossible. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new MI-based feature selection approach for microarray data. Our approach relies on two strategies: one is relevance boosting, which requires a desirable feature to show substantially additional relevance with class labeling beyond the already selected features, the other is feature interaction enhancing, which probabilistically compensates for feature interaction missing from simple aggregation-based evaluation. We justify our approach from both theoretical perspective and experimental results. We use a synthetic dataset to show the statistical significance of the proposed strategies, and real-life datasets to show the improved performance of our approach over the existing methods.",classification | feature interaction | Feature selection | gene expression profiling | mutual information,39,0,,,NSFC,61272380,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Objective of the current study is to examine the possible correlation of 9 most significant GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for T2D susceptibility as well as the interactive effect of these variants on the risk of T2D in an Indian population. Methods Case-control cohorts of 1156 individuals were genotyped for 9 SNPs from an Indian population. Association analyses were performed using logistic regression after adjusting for covariates. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was adopted to determine gene-gene interactions and discriminatory power of combined SNP effect was assessed by grouping individuals based on the number of risk alleles and by calculating area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results We confirm the association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and SLC30A8 (rs13266634) with T2D.

Cumulative analysis showed an increase in odds ratio against the baseline group of individuals carrying 5 to 6 risk alleles and discriminatory power of genetic test based on 9 variants showed higher AUC value when analyzed along with body mass index (BMI). Conclusion These results provide a strong evidence for independent association between T2D and SNPs for in TCF7L2 and SLC30A8.

As one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide, lung cancer accounts for over one million deaths each year. Generally, lung cancer can be assigned to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although great advances have been made in lung cancer detection and treatment, 5-year survival rate of patients is still less than 15%. Hence, it is very important to identify all the potential lung cancer related genes as well as their interaction networks. In this research, we presented a novel computational framework to predict lung cancer related genes based on support vector machine (SVM). 59 NSCLC related genes and 89 SCLC related genes were retrieved from KEGG pathways, while 2950 non-NSCLC and 4450 non- SCLC genes were randomly selected from Ensembl database. 10 datasets were constructed by dividing the genes into 10 groups.

However, clustering high-dimensional expression data is challenging due to noise and the curse of high-dimensionality. This article describes a disease subtyping pipeline that is able to exploit the important information available in pathway databases and clinical variables. The pipeline consists of a new feature selection procedure and existing clustering methods. Our procedure partitions a set of patients using the set of genes in each pathway as clustering features. To select the best features, this procedure estimates the relevance of each pathway and fuses relevant pathways. We show that our pipeline finds subtypes of patients with more distinctive survival profiles than traditional subtyping methods by analyzing a TCGA colon cancer gene expression dataset.

Nonetheless, micro array expression data generally have huge redundancy and are noisy, and it is only a subset of theirs which presents unique profiles for various classes of samples. Therefore, selection of genes that are hugely discriminative from the gene expression data has gone to provoke remarkable interest in the bioinformatics field. In this paper, a Krill herd (KH) is basically a new search heuristic technique. For the purpose of its performance improvement, a biogeography-based krill herd (BBKH) algorithm has been proposed for resolving complicated optimization jobs. The improvement is involved with the introduction of a novel krill migration (KM) operator having the krill updation to manage the optimization issues with more efficiency. The KM operator focuses on the usage and allows the krill to cluster around the solutions that are the best at the final run stage of the search on gene relevant to the classification. In the algorithm proposed, initially, the Infomax ICA algorithm is introduced for selecting 60 of the best gene expression data. Next, in order to make BBKH based optimization to suit the discrete issue is proposed on the basis of a binary migration model in addition to a binary mutation model using Krill herd (KH) algorithm. Then, multi-objective biogeography-based krill herd (BBKH) based optimization is called MOBBKH. Finally, the MOBBKH technique is employed for the selection of gene, and then the support vector machine is employed to be the classifier along with the leave-one-out cross-validation technique (LOOCV).To exhibit the effectiveness and resourcefulness obtained from the algorithm, this algorithm proposed is tested over ten of the gene expression dataset standards. Results obtained from experiments illustrate that the new technique has nearly good or at the least comparable performance with the earlier existing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm along with the support vector machine (SVM) while taking the quality observed from the obtained solutions into consideration.",Gene expression data | Gene selection | Hybrid approach | Multi-objective binary biogeography based optimization,2,0,,,,,

Thus, there is an urgent need to design effective computational methods for searching effective aptamers against compounds. This study attempted to extract important features for aptamer-compound interactions using feature selection methods, such as Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy, as well as incremental feature selection. Each aptamer-compound pair was represented by properties derived from the aptamer and compound, including frequencies of single nucleotides and dinucleotides for the aptamer, as well as the constitutional, electrostatic, quantum-chemical, and space conformational descriptors of the compounds. As a result, some important features were obtained. To confirm the importance of the obtained features, we further discussed the associations between them and aptamer-compound interactions.

In this regard, using topological properties of genes through the gene network reconstruction can provide more reliable findings. The main goal of this article is the prediction of breast cancer recurrence via using topological features of the relevance network reconstructed from gene expression profiles. Methods: We utilized seven gene expression microarray datasets, including 1271 samples from seven studies on breast cancer. In this study, the relevance gene network was reconstructed and FDA (Fisher Discriminant Analysis) method was applied for gene selection based on the characteristics of the network topology. To construct the gene network, we needed a profile of expressions for each gene and it could not be obtained from a single sample. Therefore, to classify a test sample, this sample was added to the training data and new gene networks were reconstructed according to two groups of high- and low-risk samples. The correlation coefficient between topological quantity vectors of the networks before and after adding test sample was calculated. The test sample was classified to the group that corresponded to higher correlation between new reconstructed network and the primary labeled network. Findings: The classification accuracy was calculated using 5-fold cross-validation based on both correlation threshold and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and non-linear support vector machines (SVM) classifier that were applied on the topological properties of reconstructed gene networks. The results confirmed the advantage of applying topological features to the kNN and the non-linear SVM classifiers. The highest accuracy in prediction with the kNN classifier was obtained via degree centrality property that reached 98.5% in average among various numbers of genes. Conclusion: Topological features of reconstructed gene networks from gene expression profiles provided more stable and accurate results in prediction of breast cancer recurrence.",Breast cancer | Gene expression | Gene regulatory networks | Topology,1,0,,,,,

The gene expression level indicates the synthesis of different messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule in a cell. Using this gene expression level, it is possible to diagnose diseases, identify tumors, select the best treatment to resist illness, detect mutations among other processes. In order to achieve that purpose, several computational techniques such as pattern classification approaches can be applied. The classification problem consists in identifying different classes or groups associated with a particular disease (e.g., various types of cancer, in terms of the gene expression level). However, the enormous quantity of genes and the few samples available, make difficult the processes of learning and recognition of any classification technique. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computational models in artificial intelligence used for classifying, predicting and approximating functions. Among the most popular ones, we could mention the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the radial basis function neural network (RBF) and support vector machine (SVM). The aim of this research is to propose a methodology for classifying DNA microarray. The proposed method performs a feature selection process based on a swarm intelligence algorithm to find a subset of genes that best describe a disease. After that, different ANN are trained using the subset of genes. Finally, four different datasets were used to validate the accuracy of the proposal and test the relevance of genes to correctly classify the samples of the disease.",Artificial Bee Colony algorithm | Artificial neural networks | Cancer classification | DNA microarrays | Pattern recognition,102,0,,,,,

Many researchers in molecular genetics have predicted a number of key genes which probably contribute to oncogenesis and potential drug targets for different types of cancer. However, this is still an ongoing process. In this article, not only the gene relevance is considered, but also the redundancy among genes is taken care of. For identifying the non-redundant gene markers from microarray gene expression data, a graph-theoretic approach has been presented. The sample versus gene data presented by microarray data are first converted into a weighted undirected complete feature-graph where the nodes represent the genes having gene's relevance as node weights and the edges are weighted according to the similarity value (correlation) among the genes. Then, the densest subgraph having minimum average edge weight (similarity) and maximum average node weight (relevance) is identified from the original feature-graph. To find the densest subgraph, binary particle swarm optimisation has been applied for minimising the average edge weight and maximising the average node weight through a single objective function. Thus, an optimised reduced subgraph is found which contains a set of selected genes for which average correlation is very less and average gene relevance is very high. The proposed method is compared with sequential forward search, T-test, Rank-sum test, minimum redundancy maximum relevance scheme, correlation-based feature selection, sequential backward elimination and fast correlation-based filter solutions in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, average correlation and stability on several real-life data-sets.",Correlation-coefficient | Gene marker | Particle swarm optimisation | Signal-to-noise ratio,7,0,,,,,

There are three major types of lung cancers, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and carcinoid. NSCLC is further classified into lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), squamous cell lung cancer (SQCLC) as well as large cell lung cancer. Many previous studies demonstrated that DNA methylation has emerged as potential lung cancer-specific biomarkers. However, whether there exists a set of DNA methylation markers simultaneously distinguishing such three types of lung cancers remains elusive. In the present study, ROC (Receiving Operating Curve), RFs (Random Forests) and mRMR (Maximum Relevancy and Minimum Redundancy) were proposed to capture the unbiased, informative as well as compact molecular signatures followed by machine learning methods to classify LADC, SQCLC and SCLC. As a result, a panel of 16 DNA methylation markers exhibits an ideal classification power with an accuracy of 86.54%, 84.6% and a recall 84.37%, 85.5% in the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and independent data set test experiments, respectively. Besides, comparison results indicate that ensemble-based feature selection methods outperform individual ones when combined with the incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy in terms of the informative and compact property of features. Taken together, results obtained suggest the effectiveness of the ensemble-based feature selection approach and the possible existence of a common panel of DNA methylation markers among such three types of lung cancer tissue, which would facilitate clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Various available versions of the MRMR approach have been designed to search for variables with the largest relevance for a classification task while controlling for redundancy of the selected set of variables. However, usual relevance and redundancy criteria have the disadvantages of being too sensitive to the presence of outlying measurements and/or being inefficient. We propose a novel approach called Minimum Regularized Redundancy Maximum Robust Relevance (MRRMRR), suitable for noisy high-dimensional data observed in two groups. It combines principles of regularization and robust statistics. Particularly, redundancy is measured by a new regularized version of the coefficient of multiple correlation and relevance is measured by a highly robust correlation coefficient based on the least weighted squares regression with data-adaptive weights. We compare various dimensionality reduction methods on three real data sets.

It has been regarded as a biomarker of oxidative stress due to its relatively early formation and stability compared with other oxidative PTMs. Only a subset of proteins is prone to carbonylation and most carbonyl groups are formed from lysine (K), arginine (R), threonine (T) and proline (P) residues. Recent advancements in analysis of the PTM by mass spectrometry provided new insights into the mechanisms of protein carbonylation, such as protein susceptibility and exact modification sites. However, the experimental approaches to identifying carbonylation sites are costly, time-consuming and capable of processing a limited number of proteins, and there is no bioinformatics method or tool devoted to predicting carbonylation sites of human proteins so far. In the paper, a computational method is proposed to identify carbonylation sites of human proteins. The method extracted four kinds of features and combined the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection criterion with weighted support vector machine (WSVM) to achieve total accuracies of 85.72%, 85.95%, 83.92% and 85.72% for K, R, T and P carbonylation site predictions respectively using 10-fold cross-validation. The final optimal feature sets were analysed, the position-specific composition and hydrophobicity environment of flanking residues of modification sites were discussed. In addition, a software tool named CarSPred has been developed to facilitate the application of the method.

In this sense, feature selection is a very important aspect of the analysis helping in the tasks of identifying relevant genes and also for maximizing predictive information. Methods. Due to its simplicity and speed, Stepwise Forward Selection (SFS) is a widely used feature selection technique. In this work, we carry a comparative study of SFS and Genetic Algorithms (GA) as general frameworks for the analysis of microarray data with the aim of identifying group of genes with high predictive capability and biological relevance. Six standard and machine learning-based techniques (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), C-MANTEC Constructive Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP)) are used within both frameworks using six free-public datasets for the task of predicting cancer outcome. Results: Better cancer outcome prediction results were obtained using the GA framework noting that this approach, in comparison to the SFS one, leads to a larger selection set, uses a large number of comparison between genetic profiles and thus it is computationally more intensive. Also the GA framework permitted to obtain a set of genes that can be considered to be more biologically relevant. Regarding the different classifiers used standard feedforward neural networks (MLP), LDA and SVM lead to similar and best results, while C-MANTEC and k-NN followed closely but with a lower accuracy. Further, C-MANTEC, MLP and LDA permitted to obtain a more limited set of genes in comparison to SVM, NB and kNN, and in particular C-MANTEC resulted in the most robust classifier in terms of changes in the parameter settings. Conclusions: This study shows that if prediction accuracy is the objective, the GA-based approach lead to better results respect to the SFS approach, independently of the classifier used. Regarding classifiers, even if C-MANTEC did not achieve the best overall results, the performance was competitive with a very robust behaviour in terms of the parameters of the algorithm, and thus it can be considered as a candidate technique for future studies. © 2014 Luque-Baena et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Constructive neural networks | Feature Selection | Genetic algorithms | Microarray,25,1,all publisherhybridgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Hybrid Gold Green,,,

Increasing availability of whole genome sequences provide the opportunity to explore the genetic foundations of a variety of functional traits. We proposed a machine learning framework to quantitatively link the genomic features with functional traits. Genes from bacteria genomes belonging to different functional traits were grouped to Cluster of Orthologs (COGs), and were used as features. Then, TF-IDF technique from the text mining domain was applied to transform the data to accommodate the abundance and importance of each COG. After TF-IDF processing, COGs were ranked using feature selection methods to identify their relevance to the functional trait of interest. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that functional trait related genes can be detected using our method. Further, the method has the potential to provide novel biological insights.

The qualitative nature of the stability property enhardens the development of practical, stability optimizing, data mining algorithms as several issues naturally arise, such as: how ""much"" stability is enough, or how can stability be effectively associated with intrinsic data properties. In the context of this work we take into account these issues and explore the effect of stability maximization in the continuous (PCA-based) k-means clustering problem. Our analysis is based on both mathematical optimization and statistical arguments that complement each other and allow for the solid interpretation of the algorithm's stability properties. Interestingly, we derive that stability maximization naturally introduces a tradeoff between cluster separation and variance, leading to the selection of features that have a high cluster separation index that is not artificially inflated by the features variance. The proposed algorithmic setup is based on a Sparse PCA approach, that selects the features that maximize stability in a greedy fashion. In our study, we also analyze several properties of Sparse PCA relevant to stability that promote Sparse PCA as a viable feature selection mechanism for clustering. The practical relevance of the proposed method is demonstrated in the context of cancer research, where we consider the problem of detecting potential tumor biomarkers using microarray gene expression data. The application of our method to a leukemia dataset shows that the tradeoff between cluster separation and variance leads to the selection of features corresponding to important biomarker genes. Some of them have relative low variance and are not detected without the direct optimization of stability in Sparse PCA based k-means. Apart from the qualitative evaluation, we have also verified our approach as a feature selection method for k k -means clustering using four cancer research datasets. The quantitative empirical results illustrate the practical utility of our framework as a feature selection mechanism for clustering. © 2013 The Author(s).",Clustering | Feature selection | Sparse PCA | Stability,21,0,,,,,

In effect, they control gene expression by targeting mRNA. They also help in carrying out normal functioning of a cell as they play an important role in various cellular processes. However, dysregulation of miRNAs is found to be a major cause of a disease. It has been demonstrated that miRNA expression is altered in many human cancers, suggesting that they may play an important role as disease biomarkers. Multiple reports have also noted the utility of miRNAs for the diagnosis of cancer. Among the large number of miRNAs present in a microarray data, a modest number might be sufficient to classify human cancers. Hence, the identification of differentially expressed miRNAs is an important problem particularly for the data sets with large number of miRNAs and small number of samples.Results: In this regard, a new miRNA selection algorithm, called μHEM, is presented based on rough hypercuboid approach. It selects a set of miRNAs from a microarray data by maximizing both relevance and significance of the selected miRNAs. The degree of dependency of sample categories on miRNAs is defined, based on the concept of hypercuboid equivalence partition matrix, to measure both relevance and significance of miRNAs. The effectiveness of the new approach is demonstrated on six publicly available miRNA expression data sets using support vector machine. The.632+ bootstrap error estimate is used to minimize the variability and biasedness of the derived results.Conclusions: An important finding is that the μHEM algorithm achieves lowest B.632+ error rate of support vector machine with a reduced set of differentially expressed miRNAs on four expression data sets compare to some existing machine learning and statistical methods, while for other two data sets, the error rate of the μHEM algorithm is comparable with the existing techniques. The results on several microarray data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can bring a remarkable improvement on miRNA selection problem. The method is a potentially useful tool for exploration of miRNA expression data and identification of differentially expressed miRNAs worth further investigation. © 2013 Paul and Maji; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Bootstrap error | Feature selection | MicroRNA | Rough hypercuboid | Support vector machine,10,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryvor,All Open Access Gold Green,INSA,SP/YSP/68/2012,Indian National Science Academy

The α-amide group is required for full biological activity, since it may render a peptide more hydrophobic and thus better be able to bind to other proteins, preventing ionization of the C-terminus. However, in particular, the C-terminal amidation is very difficult to detect because experimental methods are often labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, in silico methods may complement due to their high efficiency. In this study, a computational method was developed to predict protein amidation sites, by incorporating the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method and the incremental feature selection method based on the nearest neighbor algorithm. From a total of 735 features, 41 optimal features were selected and were utilized to construct the final predictor. As a result, the predictor achieved an overall Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.8308. Feature analysis showed that PSSM conservation scores and amino acid factors played the most important roles in the α-amidation site prediction. Site-specific feature analyses showed that features derived from the amidation site itself and adjacent sites were most significant. This method presented could be used as an efficient tool to theoretically predict amidated peptides. And the selected features from our study could shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of the amidation modification, providing guidelines for experimental validation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Amidation | Incremental feature selection | Maximum relevance minimum redundancy | Nearest neighbor algorithm,11,0,,,NSFC,81171342,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In conventional approach to mine data, we often use to join several relations to form a single relation using foreign key links, which is known as flatten. Flatten may cause problems such as time consuming, data redundancy and statistical skew on data. Hence, how to mine data directly on numerous relations become a critical issue. The solution of the given issue is the approach called multi-relational data mining (MRDM) which has been successfully applied in a variety of areas, such as marketing, sales, finance, fraud detection, natural sciences, biological. There has been many ILP-based methods proposed in previous researches, but there are still problems unsolved such as scalability i.e. how to handle large dataset with large number of relations with large number of features. Irrelevant or redundant attributes in a relation may not make contribution to classification accuracy. Thus, feature selection is an essential data preprocessing step in multi-relational data mining. By filtering out irrelevant or redundant features from relations for data mining, we improve classification accuracy, achieve good time performance, and improve comprehensibility of the models. We had proposed the method MR-MNBC which is based on MaxRel feature selection as a preprocessing task for Multi-relational Naïve Bayesian Classifier. MaxRel method uses InfoDist and Pearson's Correlation parameters, which will be used to filter out irrelevant and redundant features from the multi-relational database and will enhance classification accuracy.

The information dense, complex spectra generate massive datasets in which subtle correlations may provide critical clues for biological analysis and pathological classification. Therefore, implementing advanced data mining techniques is imperative for complete, rapid and accurate spectral processing. Numerous recent studies have employed various data methods to Raman spectra for classification and biochemical analysis. Although, as Raman datasets from biological specimens are often characterized by high dimensionality and low sample numbers, many of these classification models are subject to overfitting. Furthermore, attempts to reduce dimensionality result in transformed feature spaces making the biological evaluation of significant and discriminative spectral features problematic. We have developed a novel data mining framework optimized for Raman datasets, called Fisher-based Feature Selection Support Vector Machines (FFS-SVM). This framework provides simultaneous supervised classification and user-defined Fisher criterion-based feature selection, reducing overfitting and directly yielding significant wavenumbers from the original feature space. Herein, we investigate five cancerous and non-cancerous breast cell lines using Raman microspectroscopy and our unique FFS-SVM framework. Our framework classification performance is then compared to several other frequently employed classification methods on four classification tasks. The four tasks were constructed by an unsupervised clustering method yielding the four different categories of cell line groupings (e.g. cancer vs non-cancer) studied. FFS-SVM achieves both high classification accuracies and the extraction of biologically significant features. The top ten most discriminative features are discussed in terms of cell-type specific biological relevance. Our framework provides comprehensive cellular level characterization and could potentially lead to the discovery of cancer biomarker-type information, which we have informally termed 'Raman-based spectral biomarkers'. The FFS-SVM framework along with Raman spectroscopy will be used in future studies to investigate in-situ dynamic biological phenomena.

Methods: Two experienced radiologists marked sets of 600 rectangular 20 × 20 pixel regions of interest (ROIs) on HRCT images obtained from two scanners (GE and Siemens), including 100 ROIs for each of local patterns of lungs-normal lung and five of regional pulmonary disease patterns (ground-glass opacity, reticular opacity, honeycombing, emphysema, and consolidation). Each ROI was assessed using 22 quantitative features belonging to one of the following descriptors: histogram, gradient, run-length, gray level co-occurrence matrix, low-attenuation area cluster, and top-hat transform. For automatic classification, a Bayesian classifier and a SVM classifier were compared under three different conditions. First, classification accuracies were estimated using data from each scanner. Next, data from the GE and Siemens scanners were used for training and testing, respectively, and vice versa. Finally, all ROI data were integrated regardless of the scanner type and were then trained and tested together. All experiments were performed based on forward feature selection and fivefold cross-validation with 20 repetitions. Results: For each scanner, better classification accuracies were achieved with the SVM classifier than the Bayesian classifier (92 and 82, respectively, for the GE scanner; and 92 and 86, respectively, for the Siemens scanner). The classification accuracies were 8272 for training with GE data and testing with Siemens data, and 7972 for the reverse. The use of training and test data obtained from the HRCT images of different scanners lowered the classification accuracy compared to the use of HRCT images from the same scanner. For integrated ROI data obtained from both scanners, the classification accuracies with the SVM and Bayesian classifiers were 92 and 77, respectively. The selected features resulting from the classification process differed by scanner, with more features included for the classification of the integrated HRCT data than for the classification of the HRCT data from each scanner. For the integrated data, consisting of HRCT images of both scanners, the classification accuracy based on the SVM was statistically similar to the accuracy of the data obtained from each scanner. However, the classification accuracy of the integrated data using the Bayesian classifier was significantly lower than the classification accuracy of the ROI data of each scanner. Conclusions: The use of an integrated dataset along with a SVM classifier rather than a Bayesian classifier has benefits in terms of the classification accuracy of HRCT images acquired with more than one scanner. This finding is of relevance in studies involving large number of images, as is the case in a multicenter trial with different scanners. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",diffuse lung disease | interscanner variation | multicenter trial | naive Bayesian classifier | support vector machine,21,0,,,MKE,,Ministry of Knowledge Economy

Dimensionality reduction is among the keys in mining high-dimensional 16S rRNAs' expression data. High levels of sparsity and redundancy are common in 16S rRNA gene microbial surveys. Traditional feature selection methods are generally restricted to measuring correlated abundances, and are limited in discrimination when so few microbes are actually shared across communities.Results: Here we present a Feature Merging and Selection algorithm (FMS) to deal with 16S rRNAs' expression data. By integrating Linear Discriminant Analysis method, FMS can reduce the feature dimension with higher accuracy and preserve the relationship between different features as well. Two 16S rRNAs' expression datasets of pneumonia and dental decay patients were used to test the validity of the algorithm. Combined with SVM, FMS discriminated different classes of both pneumonia and dental caries better than other popular feature selection methods.Conclusions: FMS projects data into lower dimension with preservation of enough features, and thus improve the intelligibility of the result.

Feature selection algorithms can be broadly categorized into two main groups: filter-based methods and wrapper-based methods. Filter-based methods have been quite popular in the literature due to their many advantages, including computational efficiency, simplistic architecture, and an intuitively simple means of discovering biological and clinical aspects. However, these methods have limitations, and the classification accuracy of the selected genes is less accurate. In this paper, we propose a set of univariate filter-based methods using a between-class overlapping criterion. The proposed techniques have been compared with many other univariate filter-based methods using an acute leukemia dataset. The following properties have been examined: classification accuracy of the selected individual genes and the gene subsets; redundancy check among selected genes using ridge regression and LASSO methods; similarity and sensitivity analyses; functional analysis; and, stability analysis. A comprehensive experiment shows promising results for our proposed techniques. The univariate filter based methods using between-class overlapping criterion are accurate and robust, have biological significance, and are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Therefore, they are well suited for biological and clinical discoveries. © 2012 Imperial College Press.",between-class overlapping | Feature selection | filter-based method | transcriptome data,25,0,,,KAKEN,22-00364,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

Enzymes are proteins that catalyze bio-chemical reactions and play an important role in metabolic pathways. Commonly, function of such enzymes is determined by experiments that can be time consuming and costly. Hence, a need for a computing method is felt that can distinguish protein enzyme sequences from those of non-enzymes and reliably predict the function of the former. To address this problem, approaches that cluster enzymes based on their sequence and structural similarity have been presented. But, these approaches are known to fail for proteins that perform the same function and are dissimilar in their sequence and structure. In this article, we present a supervised machine learning model to predict the function class and sub-class ofenzymes based on a set of 73 sequence-derived features. The functional classes are as defined by International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Using an efficient data mining algorithm called random forest, we construct a top-down three layer model where the top layer classifies a query protein sequence as an enzyme or non-enzyme, the second layer predicts the main function class and bottom layer further predicts the sub-function class. The model reported overall classification accuracy of 94.87% for the first level, 87.7% for the second, and 84.25% for the bottom level. Our results compare very well with existing methods, and in many cases report better performance.

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how clinical data can be weighted, scored and presented by the use of an eight-step data-driven benefit-risk assessment method, where two genetic profiles are compared. Our aim was to present a comprehensive approach that is simple to apply, allows direct comparison of different types of risks and benefits, quantifies the clinical relevance of data and is tailored for the comparison of different options. We analysed a cohort of 302 patients with colorectal cancer treated with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Endpoints were cure rate, survival rate, time-to-death (TTD), time-to-relapse (TTR) and main adverse drug reactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to identify genetic interaction profiles associated with outcome. We have been able to demonstrate that a specific MDR-derived combination (the MDR-1 group) of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms is associated with increased and clinically significant difference for cure and survival rates, TTD and probably also for TTR, which are seen as the most important endpoints. An inferior profile was observed for severe myocardial ischaemia. A probably inferior profile was seen for severe arthralgia/myalgia and severe infections. A clear superior profile was seen for severe mucositis/stomatitis. The proposed approach offers comprehensive, data-driven assessment that can facilitate decision processes, for example, in a clinical setting.

The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has dramatically increased the amount of completed bacterial genomes, for both known human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains; this information is now available to investigate genetic features that determine pathogenic phenotypes in bacteria. In this work we determined presence/absence patterns of 814 different virulence-related genes among more than 600 finished bacterial genomes from both human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, belonging to different taxonomic groups (i.e: Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, etc.). An accuracy of 95% using a cross-fold validation scheme with in-fold feature selection is obtained when classifying human pathogens and non-pathogens. A reduced subset of highly informative genes (120) is presented and applied to an external validation set. The statistical model was implemented in the BacFier v1.0 software (freely available at http://bacfier.googlecode.com/files/Bacfier_v1_0.zip), that displays not only the prediction (pathogen/non-pathogen) and an associated probability for pathogenicity, but also the presence/absence vector for the analyzed genes, so it is possible to decipher the subset of virulence genes responsible for the classification on the analyzed genome. Furthermore, we discuss the biological relevance for bacterial pathogenesis of the core set of genes, corresponding to eight functional categories, all with evident and documented association with the phenotypes of interest. Also, we analyze which functional categories of virulence genes were more distinctive for pathogenicity in each taxonomic group, which seems to be a completely new kind of information and could lead to important evolutionary conclusions. © 2012 Iraola et al.",,16,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

Approximately, 50% of developing drugs fail because of unfavorable oral bioavailability. In silico prediction of oral bioavailability (%F) based on physiochemical properties are highly needed. Although many computational models have been developed to predict oral bioavailability, their accuracy remains low with a significant number of false positives. In this study, we present an oral bioavailability model based on systems biological approach, using a machine learning algorithm coupled with an optimal discriminative set of physiochemical properties. Results: The models were developed based on computationally derived 247 physicochemical descriptors from 2279 molecules, among which 969, 605 and 705 molecules were corresponds to oral bioavailability, intestinal absorption (HIA) and caco-2 permeability data set, respectively. The partial least squares discriminate analysis showed 49 descriptors of HIA and 50 descriptors of caco-2 are the major contributing descriptors in classifying into groups. Of these descriptors, 47 descriptors were commonly associated to HIA and caco-2, which suggests to play a vital role in classifying oral bioavailability. To determine the best machine learning algorithm, 21 classifiers were compared using a bioavailability data set of 969 molecules with 47 descriptors. Each molecule in the data set was represented by a set of 47 physiochemical properties with the functional relevance labeled as (+bioavailability/-bioavailability) to indicate good-bioavailability/poor-bioavailability molecules. The best-performing algorithm was the logistic algorithm. The correlation based feature selection (CFS) algorithm was implemented, which confirms that these 47 descriptors are the fundamental descriptors for oral bioavailability prediction.

One of the major tasks with gene expression data is to find co-regulated gene groups whose collective expression is strongly associated with sample categories. In this regard, a gene clustering algorithm is proposed to group genes from microarray data. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories in the grouping process for finding groups of co-regulated genes with strong association to the sample categories, yielding a supervised gene clustering algorithm. The average expression of the genes from each cluster acts as its representative. Some significant representatives are taken to form the reduced feature set to build the classifiers for cancer classification. The mutual information is used to compute both gene-gene redundancy and gene-class relevance. The performance of the proposed method, along with a comparison with existing methods, is studied on six cancer microarray data sets using the predictive accuracy of naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor rule, and support vector machine.

For efficient classification of samples there is a need of selecting a smaller set of relevant and non-redundant genes. In this paper, we have proposed a two stage algorithm for finding a set of discriminatory genes responsible for classification of high dimensional microarray datasets. In the first stage redundancy is reduced by grouping correlated genes into clusters and selecting a representative gene from each cluster. Maximal information compression index is used to measure similarity between genes. In the second stage a wrapper based forward feature selection method is used to obtain a set of discriminatory genes for a given classifier.

Biomarker discovery can be modelled as a feature selection problem that aims to find the most discriminating features (genes) for accurate disease classification e.g. healthy vs. diseased samples. Typical feature selection algorithms identify individual genes, and the disease discrimination power of each gene is considered separately. In this paper, we propose a gene selection method incorporating prior biological knowledge about gene pathways to find a group(s) of strongly correlated genes to accurately discriminate complex as well as simple diseases. The proposed method involves a ranking process to identify the most relevant biological pathways in a microarray dataset. A specified number of differentially-expressed genes from relevant pathways is then selected for accurate disease classification. The advantage of this method is that it searches for a group of strongly correlated genes rather than individual genes. We argue that selecting a group of informative and correlated genes from disease-associated pathways is particularly relevant to the disease type or grade. To evaluate the performance of our method, we compare it to five wellknown feature selection and ranking methods using two classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using publicly-available microarray datasets, we found that our algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of disease classification accuracy. Moreover, we were able to reduce the number of genes required to accurately discriminate disease states. © 2011 IEEE.",Biomarker discovery | Component | Disease classification | Feature selection | Gene selection | Pathway analysis,8,0,,,,,

Moreover, features represented by probes that either have similar molecular functions (gene expression analysis) or genomic locations (DNA copy number analysis) are highly correlated. Classical model selection methods such as penalized logistic regression or random forest become unstable in the presence of high feature correlations. Sophisticated penalties such as group Lasso or fused Lasso can force the models to assign similar weights to correlated features and thus improve model stability and interpretability. In this article, we show that the measures of feature relevance corresponding to the above-mentioned methods are biased such that the weights of the features belonging to groups of correlated features decrease as the sizes of the groups increase, which leads to incorrect model interpretation and misleading feature ranking. Results: With simulation experiments, we demonstrate that Lasso logistic regression, fused support vector machine, group Lasso and random forest models suffer from correlation bias. Using simulations, we show that two related methods for group selection based on feature clustering can be used for correcting the correlation bias. These techniques also improve the stability and the accuracy of the baseline models.

This knowledge can be encoded in a network whose nodes correspond to features and whose edges connect features that should be either both excluded or both included in the predictive model. In this paper, we introduce a novel network-based sparse Bayesian classifier (NBSBC) that makes use of the information about feature dependencies encoded in such a network to improve its prediction accuracy, especially in problems with a high-dimensional feature space and a limited amount of available training data. Approximate Bayesian inference is efficiently implemented in this model using expectation propagation. The NBSBC method is validated on four real-world classification problems from different domains of application: phonemes, handwritten digits, precipitation records and gene expression measurements. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods (support vector machine, network-based support vector machine and graph lasso) show that NBSBC has excellent predictive performance. It has the best accuracy in three of the four problems analyzed and ranks second in the modeling of the precipitation data. NBSBC also yields accurate and robust rankings of the individual features according to their relevance to the solution of the classification problem considered. The accuracy and stability of these estimates is an important factor in the good overall performance of this method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we explore the effect of stability optimization in the standard feature selection process for the continuous (PCA-based) k-means clustering problem. Interestingly, we derive that stability maximization naturally introduces a tradeoff between cluster separation and variance, leading to the selection of features that have a high cluster separation index that is not artificially inflated by the feature's variance. The proposed algorithmic setup is based on a Sparse PCA approach, that selects the features that maximize stability in a greedy fashion. In our study, we also analyze several properties of Sparse PCA relevant to stability that promote Sparse PCA as a viable feature selection mechanism for clustering. The practical relevance of the proposed method is demonstrated in the context of cancer research, where we consider the problem of detecting potential tumor biomarkers using microarray gene expression data. The application of our method to a leukemia dataset shows that the tradeoff between cluster separation and variance leads to the selection of features corresponding to important biomarker genes.

Although the two factors are interrelated learning problems, most studies tackle each separately. In this paper, expression levels of genes are used for both cancer subtype classification and survival prediction. We considered 350 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subjects, taken from four groups of patients (activated B-cell-like subtype dead, activated B-cell-like subtype alive, germinal center B-cell-like subtype dead, and germinal center B-cell-like subtype alive). As classification features, we used 11,271 gene expression levels of each subject. The features were first ranked by mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) principle and further selected by IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) procedure. Thirty-five gene signatures were selected after the IFS procedure, and the patients were divided into the above mentioned four groups. These four groups were combined in different ways for subtype prediction and survival prediction, specifically, the activated versus the germinal center and the alive versus the dead. Subtype prediction accuracy of the 35-gene signature was 98.6%. We calculated cumulative survival time of high-risk group and low-risk groups by the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test p-value was 5.98e-08. Our methodology provides a way to study subtype classification and survival prediction simultaneously. Our results suggest that for some diseases, especially cancer, subtype classification may be used to predict survival, and, conversely, survival prediction features may shed light on subtype features. © 2010 Cai et al.",,31,1,all publisherfullgold repository repositoryam,All Open Access Gold Green,,,

Selecting an appropriate subset of features can improve classification or clustering and lead to better understanding of the data. An important example is that of finding an informative group of genes out of thousands that appear in gene-expression analysis. Numerous supervised methods have been suggested but only a few unsupervised ones exist. Unsupervised Feature Filtering (UFF) is such a method, based on an entropy measure of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), ranking features and selecting a group of preferred ones.Results: We analyze the statistical properties of UFF and present an efficient approximation for the calculation of its entropy measure. This allows us to develop a web-tool that implements the UFF algorithm. We propose novel criteria to indicate whether a considered dataset is amenable to feature selection by UFF. Relying on formalism similar to UFF we propose also an Unsupervised Detection of Outliers (UDO) method, providing a novel definition of outliers and producing a measure to rank the ""outlier-degree"" of an instance.Our methods are demonstrated on gene and microRNA expression datasets, covering viral infection disease and cancer. We apply UFFizi to select genes from these datasets and discuss their biological and medical relevance.Conclusions: Statistical properties extracted from the UFF algorithm can distinguish selected features from others. UFFizi is a framework that is based on the UFF algorithm and it is applicable for a wide range of diseases.

It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone.

Methods/Principal Findings:To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48%, 80.78%, 78.49%, and 85.66%, respectively.

Methods Gaussian processes, including automatic relevance detection (GPRARD) methods, were employed to develop models of percutaneous absorption that identified key physicochemical descriptors of percutaneous absorption. Using MatLab software, the statistical performance of these models was compared with single linear networks (SLN) and quantitative structure-permeability relationships (QSPRs). Feature selection methods were used to examine in more detail the physicochemical parameters used in this study. A range of statistical measures to determine model quality were used. Key findings The inherently nonlinear nature of the skin data set was confirmed. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods yielded predictive models that offered statistically significant improvements over SLN and QSPR models with regard to predictivity (where the rank order was: GPR > SLN > QSPR). Feature selection analysis determined that the best GPR models were those that contained log P, melting point and the number of hydrogen bond donor groups as significant descriptors. Further statistical analysis also found that great synergy existed between certain parameters. It suggested that a number of the descriptors employed were effectively interchangeable, thus questioning the use of models where discrete variables are output, usually in the form of an equation. Conclusions The use of a nonlinear GPR method produced models with significantly improved predictivity, compared with SLN or QSPR models. Feature selection methods were able to provide important mechanistic information. However, it was also shown that significant synergy existed between certain parameters, and as such it was possible to interchange certain descriptors (i.e. molecular weight and melting point) without incurring a loss of model quality. Such synergy suggested that a model constructed from discrete terms in an equation may not be the most appropriate way of representing mechanistic understandings of skin absorption. © 2010 Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.",Gaussian process | Machine learning methods | Percutaneous absorption | Quantitative structure-permeability relationships,26,0,,,,,

Current lung cancer prognosis using staging system has been studied and proven to be not accurate enough, especially on early stages. Therefore, a new prognostic model is desired. Using gene expression values of 442 Affymetrix U133A microarray data, we identified a 15-gene and a 12-gene signatures and constructed prediction models for NSCLC overall survival. The set of 442 samples were separated into three sets: UM/HLM as training set (n=256), MSK as first test set (n=104), and DFCI as second test set (n=82). The 15-gene signature was identified from combination of t-test and RFLIEFF feature selection. By fitting the 15 genes into Cox proportional hazard model and using the median risk scores as the cut-off, patients in training set and both testing sets were stratified into two distinct survival groups significantly (log-rank P ≤ 0.02) in KM analysis. This model was further studied on early stage patients. In KM analysis, the stratification was not significant on MSK stage 1 (log-rank P = 0.12) but significant on DFCI stage 1 (log-rank P = 0.02). The model was able to further stratified stage 1B patients into two distinct risk groups (log-rank P = 0.00765) as well. The 12-gene signature was identified from combination of t-test, SAM statistics, and RELIEFF feature selection. Naïve-Bayes classifier was used to construct the prognostic model based on 5-year survival data. The 12-gene model also provided significant stratifications (log-rank P ≤ 0.001) in KM analysis on both training and test sets. Furthermore, the 12-gene model significantly stratified stage 1 patients on both test sets (log-rank P ≤ 0.04) in KM analysis. Consistent to 15-gene, this 12-gene model was able to significantly stratified stage 1B patients (log-rank P = 0.0047) but not stage 1A patients. Results showed that both signatures were as significant as other published gene signatures of larger size. Also, these two gene signatures shared two common genes and the performances on the two prognostic models were comparative. Therefore, in addition to comparing the predictive performance of the models, we used IPA to further study the biological relevance of both signatures. ©2009 IEEE.",Gene signature | Gene-expression based prediction model | Microarray | NSCLC,3,0,,,,,

Much effort has been put into identifying protein complexes using computational approaches. A vast majority attempt to research densely connected regions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network/graph. In this research, we try an alterative approach to analyze protein complexes using hybrid features and present a method to determine whether multiple (more than two) proteins from yeast can form a protein complex. The data set consists of 493 positive protein complexes and 9878 negative protein complexes. Every complex is represented by graph features, where proteins in the complex form a graph (web) of interactions, and features derived from biological properties including protein length, biochemical properties and physicochemical properties. These features are filtered and optimized by Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance method, Incremental Feature Selection and Forward Feature Selection, established through a prediction/identification model called Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. Jackknife cross-validation test is employed to evaluate the identification accuracy. As a result, the highest accuracy for the identification of the real protein complexes using filtered features is 69.17%, and feature analysis shows that, among the adopted features, graph features play the main roles in the determination of protein complexes. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",Feature selection | Jackknife cross-validation test | mRMR(minimum redundancy maximum relevance) | Nearest neighbor algorithm (NNA) | Protein complex | Protein-protein interaction (PPI),29,0,,,,,

Many proteins have binding sites that are highly specific to glucose. The exponential increase of genomic data has revealed the identity of many proteins that seem to be central to biological processes, but whose exact functions are unknown. Many of these proteins seem to be associated with disease processes. Being able to predict glucose-specific binding sites in these proteins will greatly enhance our ability to annotate protein function and may significantly contribute to drug design. We hereby present the first glucose-binding site classifier algorithm. We consider the sugar-binding pocket as a spherical spatio-chemical environment and represent it as a vector of geometric and chemical features. We then perform Random Forests feature selection to identify key features and analyze them using support vector machines classification. Our work shows that glucose binding sites can be modeled effectively using a limited number of basic chemical and residue features. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation method, our classifier achieves a 8.11% error, a 89.66% sensitivity and a 93.33% specificity over our dataset.

Recently unsupervised feature selection has attracted a lot of attention especially in bioinformatics and text mining. So far, supervised feature selection and unsupervised feature selection method are studied and developed separately. A subset selected by a supervised feature selection method may not be a good one for unsupervised learning and vice verse. In bioinformatics research, however it is very common to perform clustering and classification iteratively for the same data sets, especially in gene expression analysis, thus it is very desirable to have a feature selection method which works well for both unsupervised learning and supervised learning. In this paper we propose a novel feature selection algorithm through feature clustering. Our algorithm does not need the class label information in the data set and is suitable for both supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Our algorithm groups the features into different clusters based on feature similarity, so that the features in the same clusters are similar to each other. A representative feature is selected from each cluster, thus reduces the feature redundancy. Our feature selection algorithm uses feature similarity for feature redundancy reduction but requires no feature search, works very well for high dimensional data set. We test our algorithm on some biological data sets for both clustering and classification analysis and the results indicates that our FSFC algorithm can significantly reduce the original data sets without scarifying the quality of clustering and classification.",,36,0,,,,,

Recently, it has been used for feature selection for microarray gene expression data. One of the merits of MI is, unlike many other heuristic methods, it is based on a mature theoretic foundation. When applied to microarray data, however, it faces a number of challenges. Firstly, due to large numbers of features (i.e., genes) present in microarrays, the true distributions for the expression values of some genes may be masked by noises. Secondly, evaluating inter-group mutual information requires estimating multi-variate distributions, which is difficult. To address the first problem, we use a scheme called Substantial relevance boosting, which requires a non-noisy feature to show substantially additional relevance with class labeling beyond the already selected features. To address the second problem, we use Increasing likelihood of feature interaction, which probabilistically compensates for feature interaction missing from simple aggregation-based simulation. We justify our strategies from both a theoretical perspective, and the experimental results on real life data sets, which show the improved effectiveness of our method over the existing schemes.",Classification | Feature interaction | Feature selection | Gene expression profiling | Mutual information,0,0,,,NSFC,60573183,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The most vital information to be represented is the characteristics embedded in the raw data most essential for the intended applications. In order to extract a useful high-level representation, it is desirable that a representation can provide concise, invariant, and/or intelligible information on input patterns. The curse of dimensionality has traditionally been a serious concern in many genomic applications. For example, the feature dimension of gene expression data is often in the order of thousands. This motivates exploration into feature selection and representation, both aiming at reducing the feature dimensionality to facilitate the training and prediction of genomic data. The challenge lies in how to reduce feature dimension while conceding minimum sacrifice on accuracy. For feature selection, both individual and group information are important, and each has its own pros and cons in measuring the truly relevant information. The individual quantification is simple as each of the M features can be represented by one single value. However, it cannot deal with the inter-feature redundancy, abounding specially in genomic data. In contrast, the group information can fully address the mutual redundancy, but it is often too complicated to process. (Note that there are 2<sup>M</sup> possible groups.) Between the two extremes, fortunately, there is a convenient compromise: the pairwise kernel - which has a low complexity (M<sup>2</sup> pairs) and yet reveals the critical information regarding the m inter-feature redundancy. Indeed, it has been already found very useful for many genomic applications. Especially, we shall describe how pairwise-based feature selection may be successful applied to genomic subcellular localization. A special method (VIA-SVM) designed exclusively for pairwise scoring kernels is introduced. This is the first method that fully utilizes the reflexive property of the so-called self-supervised training data, arising uniquely available in multiple sequence alignment. Based on several subcellular localization experiments, the VIA-SVM when combined with some filter-type metrics appears to deliver a substantial dimension reduction (one-order of magnitude) with only little degradation on accuracy. © 2007 IEEE.",,0,0,,,,,

It is capable of selecting relatively few marker genes while giving comparable or better leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy when compared with gene ranking selection approaches. Additionally, gene profiles can be extracted from the evolving connectionist system, which provides a set of rules that can be further developed into expert systems. The approach uses an integration of Pearson correlation coefficient and signal-to-noise ratio methods with an adaptive evolving classifier applied through the leave-one-out method for validation.

These studies resulted in specificities and sensitivities in the range of 0.7 to 0.76. Recently, we have trained support vector machines (SVMs) to classify images of healthy and diseased joints. By eliminating redundancy using feature selection, we are achieving sensitivities of 0.72 and specificities up to 1.0. Studies with larger patient groups are necessary to validate these findings; but these initial results support the expectation that SVMs and other machine learning techniques can considerably improve image interpretation analysis in optical tomography.",Feature selection | Machine learning | Optical tomography | Rheumatoid arthritis | Support vector machines,4,0,,,,,

The approach uses heavy-tailed priors to promote sparsity in the utilization of both basis functions and features; these priors act as regularizers for the likelihood function that rewards good classification on the training data. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to efficiently compute a maximum a posteriori (MAP) point estimate of the various parameters. The algorithm is an extension of recent state-of-the-art sparse Bayesian classifiers, which in turn can be seen as Bayesian counterparts of support vector machines. Experimental comparisons using kernel classifiers demonstrate both parsimonious feature selection and excellent classification accuracy on a range of synthetic and benchmark data sets. © 2004 IEEE.",,141,0,,,,,

In the context of clinical diagnosis, the central goal of class discovery algorithms is to simultaneously find putative (sub-)types of diseases and to identify informative subsets of genes with disease-type specific expression profile. Contrary to many other approaches in the literature, the method presented implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing the discriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. The usual combinatorial problems associated with wrapper approaches are overcome by a Bayesian inference mechanism. On the technical side, we present an efficient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. The only free parameter of the optimization method is selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments with Leukemia and Lymphoma datasets demonstrate that our method is able to correctly infer partitions and corresponding subsets of genes which both are relevant in a biological sense. Moreover, the frequently observed problem of ambiguities caused by different but equally high-scoring partitions, is successfully overcome by the model selection method proposed.",Automatic relevance determination | Bayesian inference | Class discovery | Gene expression | Gene selection,30,0,,,DFG,BU 914/4,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Clustering suffers from the curse of dimensionality. It is not meaningful to look for clusters in high dimensional spaces as the average density of points anywhere in input space is likely to be low. As a consequence, distance functions that equally use all input features may be ineffective. We introduce an algorithm that discovers clusters in subspaces spanned by different combinations of dimensions via local weightings of features. This approach avoids the risk of loss of information encountered in global dimensionality reduction techniques. Our method associates to each cluster a weight vector, whose values capture the relevance of features within the corresponding cluster.

In biological treatment systems, the most dominating groups observed are Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Acinetobactor, Burkholderia, and Alcaligenes. Our interest lies in identifying the distinguishing features of these bacterial groups based on their 16S rDNA sequence data, which could be used further for generating genus-specific probes. Accordingly, 20 sequences representing different species from each genus above were retrieved, which constituted a training set. A 16-dimensional feature vector comprised of transition probabilities of nucleotides was considered and each sampled sequence was expressed in terms of these features. A stepwise feature selection method was used to identify features that are distinct across the species of these five groups. Wilk's lambda selection criterion was used and resulted in a subset with six distinguishing features. The discriminating efficacy of this subset was tested through multiple group discriminant analysis. Two linear composites, as a function of these features, could discriminate the test set of forty-five sequences from these groups with 95% accuracy, thereby ascertaining the relevance of the identified features. The geometric representation of feature correlation in the reduced discriminant space demonstrated the dominance of identified features in specific groups. These features independently or in combination could be used to generate genus-specific patterns to design probes, so as to develop a tracking tool for the selected group of bacteria.",Bioremediation | Discriminant loadings | Step-wise feature selection | Tolerance | Wilk's lambda,10,0,,,,,

This clustering problem is difficult for several reasons, in particular the sparsity of the data, the high dimensionality of the feature (gene) space, and the fact that many features are irrelevant or redundant. Our algorithm iterates between two computational processes, feature filtering and clustering. Given a reference partition that approximates the correct clustering of the samples, our feature filtering procedure ranks the features according to their intrinsic discriminability, relevance to the reference partition, and irredundancy to other relevant features, and uses this ranking to select the features to be used in the following round of clustering. Our clustering algorithm, which is based on the concept of a normalized cut, clusters the samples into a new reference partition on the basis of the selected features. On a well-studied problem involving 72 leukemia samples and 7130 genes, we demonstrate that CLIFF outperforms standard clustering approaches that do not consider the feature selection issue, and produces a result that is very close to the original expert labeling of the sample set. © Oxford University Press 2001.",,168,1,all publisherfree2read,All Open Access Bronze,,,
