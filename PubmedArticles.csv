34990009",Integrative multi-omics stratification and translational evaluation of Treg-targeted combination immunotherapy in breast cancer.,"Immunosuppressive breast cancer subtypes driven by regulatory T cells (Tregs) remain under-characterized, limiting precise identification of patients who may benefit from immunomodulatory therapies. Tregs are key mediators of immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are closely associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Therefore, defining and characterizing tumors with predominant Treg-mediated immunosuppression is essential for optimizing the use of Treg-targeted and combination immunotherapies.
We applied an unsupervised multi-omics integration approach across four molecular layers - mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and proteomics -to identify immunologically distinct subtypes of breast cancer. Autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction followed by consensus clustering revealed a subgroup characterized by high Treg infiltration and immunosuppressive signaling, referred to as the Treg-enriched subtype. To evaluate therapeutic strategies, we employed a spatial quantitative systems pharmacology (spQSP) model simulating tumor-immune dynamics and tested Treg-targeted and PD-1 blockade therapies both alone and in combination. 
The C2 cluster exhibited elevated Treg-related signatures and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. A similar Treg-enriched cluster was also identified in an independent cohort, supporting the robustness and clinical relevance of this immunosuppressive subtype. In-silico simulations performed under a C2-like, immunosuppressive context predicted that combining Treg-targeted therapy with PD-1 blockade would substantially enhance immune activation and tumor control compared with monotherapy. To experimentally validate these predictions, combination treatment of a CCR8 inhibitor (IPG7236) and anti-PD-L1 antibody demonstrated greater tumor growth inhibition than either monotherapy in the EMT6 model, confirming the predicted therapeutic synergy in Treg-enriched, immune-suppressive tumors.

1,41518988,"Knowledge graph integration of clustered medicinal plants, molecules, diseases, and targets.","This study builds on the premise that phytochemicals, when co-existing across multiple plant species, tend to form structural and functional clusters. While individual compounds may exhibit distinct pharmacological properties in isolation, their behaviour within molecular clusters often diverges, potentially leading to emergent synergistic effects. Leveraging this insight, we systematically analysed 490 phytoconstituents derived from ten medicinal plants belonging to the Dasamoola group. Through chemoinformatic clustering using K-Means and dimensionality reduction via t-SNE, these molecules were organised into 49 structurally coherent clusters. Pharmacological relevance was assessed by mapping clusters to 87 ICD-11-classified disease conditions, thereby integrating clustering, ICD-11 mapping, and knowledge-graph visualization into a unified workflow that can serve as a template for analysing other complex polyherbal formulations. Heat map analyses revealed significant correlations between molecular clusters and disease phenotypes, indicating potential poly pharmacological mechanisms. To further elucidate these relationships, predicted molecular targets were integrated with disease ontologies using a Neo4j-based knowledge graph framework. This network-based approach enabled the visualization of molecule-target-disease associations, suggesting mechanistic insights that extend beyond conventional reductionist perspectives in an exploratory manner. Overall, our findings suggest potential molecular-target-disease associations that link structurally related phytochemicals to defined disease categories through shared biological targets. These associations indicate plausible network-level relationships and offer new avenues for, understanding the systems-level pharmacology of traditional medicinal formulations, generating testable hypothesis that warrant further experimental validation.","AI-based therapeutic mapping"", ""Chemical space analysis"", ""K means clustering"", ""Molecular clustering"", ""Neo4j knowledge graph",2026-01-11

31707044",Feature learning augmented with sampling and heuristics (FLASH) improves model performance and biomarker identification.,"Big biological datasets, such as gene expression profiles, often contain redundant features that degrade model performance and limit generalization across independent datasets with complexities like class imbalance and hidden sub-clusters. To overcome challenges, we present 'FLASH', a novel feature selection method combining filtration and heuristic-based systematic elimination. FLASH generates random samples and computes p-values for each feature using multiple statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum, Brunner-Munzel, Mann-Whitney). Features are scored by aggregating significant p-values across samples. The coefficient from the machine learning model with the highest accuracy on the filtered features is used to rank them. Recursive elimination with cross-validation systematically removes features while monitoring accuracy. The final subset is selected based on the highest performance during elimination, to achieve effective feature selection. We show that our method preserves predictive performance on independent datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse datasets showed that FLASH outperforms the compared feature selection methods dRFE, Mutual information, MRMR, ElasticNet, NeuralNet, Permutation test and SAGA within the scope of our tested datasets and evaluation settings. Additionally, features selected by FLASH demonstrated greater biological relevance, as evidenced by higher overlap with disease-associated genes from DisGeNET in an independent dataset.","AI-based therapeutic mapping"", ""Chemical space analysis"", ""K means clustering"", ""Molecular clustering"", ""Neo4j knowledge graph",2025-12-13

37307911",Machine learning-based prediction of drug response in ischemia reperfusion animal model.,"Myocardial ischemia is a major global contributor to mortality. While reperfusion therapy remains the most effective treatment, it paradoxically leads to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury, resulting in irreversible cardiac damage for which no effective interventions currently exist. This underscores the pressing need to unravel the pathogenesis of MI/R injury and devise new therapeutic strategies. In this study, supervised machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), neural networks (NN), and k-nearest neighbors (kNN), were utilized to predict treatment response. The models incorporated molecular and biochemical features to evaluate three drugs: trans-Anethole (TNA), pentoxifylline (PTX), and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (Cy3G). The sequential forward selection (SFS) method was employed to select the most relevant features for prediction. To assess model performance, metrics such as precision, accuracy, recall (sensitivity), specificity, and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) were analyzed for both reduced and complete models. Among the classifiers, kNN demonstrated notable performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9156 ± 0.0242 and an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.90 across three cross-validation iterations surpassing all other classifiers. This observed performance is in line with recent literature that employs advanced computational methods in similar domains. A key advantage of our study is the use of a two-layer framework-integrating molecular signatures with biochemical markers-which can provide improved robustness and biological relevance. This multi-layer integration enhances interpretability and better reflects the multifactorial nature of MI/R injury, while supporting model generalization. Feature selection identified one molecular marker (SOX5) and two biochemical markers (dP/dtmax and cTnT) as significant predictors of drug response. This integrative approach has the potential to enhance personalized therapy for myocardial ischemia by enabling precise drug response predictions and guiding the development of targeted treatment strategies.","Anti-inflammatory therapy"", ""Cardioprotection"", ""Dose-dependent effects"", ""Epigenetic regulation"", ""Machine learning"", ""Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion (MI/R) injury",2025-12-03

31182017",A Multi-Task Ensemble Strategy for Gene Selection and Cancer Classification.,"Gene expression-based tumor classification aims to distinguish tumor types based on gene expression profiles. This task is difficult due to the high dimensionality of gene expression data and limited sample sizes. Most datasets contain tens of thousands of genes but only a small number of samples. As a result, selecting informative genes is necessary to improve classification performance and model interpretability. Many existing gene selection methods fail to produce stable and consistent results, especially when training data are limited. To address this, we propose a multi-task ensemble strategy that combines repeated sampling with joint feature selection and classification. The method generates multiple training subsets and applies multi-task logistic regression with ℓ2,1 group sparsity regularization to select a subset of genes that appears consistently across tasks. This promotes stability and reduces redundancy. The framework supports integration with standard classifiers such as logistic regression and support vector machines. It performs both gene selection and classification in a single process. We evaluate the method on simulated and real gene expression datasets. The results show that it outperforms several baseline methods in classification accuracy and the consistency of selected genes.","gene expression-based tumor classification"", ""gene selection"", ""multi-task ensemble strategy",2025-11-27

34320340",Uncovering Key Genes in Neurodegenerative Diseases Through Unsupervised Learning: A Variance-Based LSTM and Enrichment Analysis Approach.,"This study presents an integrated approach for discovering and clustering significant genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases using a combination of variance-based filtering, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, and enrichment analysis. By first filtering genes based on their variance across samples, we retain genes with high biological relevance. These selected genes are then used to train an LSTM model, capturing complex interactions between gene expression patterns. Using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means for clustering, we group genes with similar expression profiles. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Silhouette Score. To refine the model, we introduce a feedback loop where cluster labels are fed back into the LSTM as additional features, enhancing the model's ability to detect significant gene associations. We compare various network architectures to assess their impact on clustering performance. Finally, enrichment analysis reveals key biological pathways, such as immune regulation and protein signaling, related to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning and clustering to uncover meaningful gene associations, offering insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.","Alzheimer’s disease (AD)"", ""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)"", ""Biomarker discovery"", ""Enrichment analysis"", ""Feature selection"", ""Gene clustering"", ""High-dimensional data analysis"", ""LSTM"", ""Neurodegenerative diseases"", ""Parkinson’s disease (PD)"", ""Unsupervised learning",2025-11-22

This study investigated whether patterns of inter-regional glucose uptake coordination, derived from whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT, could reveal latent subclinical metabolic phenotypes among normoglycemic adults.
We analyzed 536 clinically normoglycemic adults (fasting blood glucose < 6.1 mmol/L) who underwent whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT. For each subject, pairwise lean body mass normalized standardized uptake value ratios (SUL
Two distinct metabolic phenotypes were identified within the normoglycemic cohort (Phenotype A and Phenotype B), with no significant differences in age, sex, BMI, or fasting blood glucose. Phenotype A was characterized by lower myocardium-to-peripheral ratios (versus adipose, skeletal muscle, and lung) and higher brain-to-myocardium and brain-to-fat ratios compared to Phenotype B. At the network level, Phenotype A showed stronger positive correlations between myocardial and peripheral uptakes, indicating tighter systemic coupling despite reduced relative cardiac allocation. These patterns qualitatively mirrored those observed in prediabetic and diabetic groups.
Whole-body ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT identified metabolically distinct phenotypes in adults with normal fasting glucose, differentiated by both pairwise uptake ratios and systemic network coordination. These findings highlight latent metabolic heterogeneity in clinically healthy individuals and provide a basis for future investigations into early systemic metabolic alterations.","18F-FDG"", ""Clustering"", ""Diabetics"", ""Gaussian mixture model"", ""Metabolic phenotyping"", ""Normoglycemia"", ""Whole-body PET/CT",2025-11-18

9,41213031,Decoding tumor heterogeneity with imaging biomarkers predicts response to TACE plus immunotherapy and targeted therapy in HCC (CHANCE2204).,"This study aims to quantify intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and identify prognostic imaging biomarkers in patients with HCC treated with transarterial chemoembolization combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor plus molecular targeted therapy (TACE-ICI-MTT).
This multicenter cohort study included 742 patients with unresectable HCC who received first-line TACE-ICI-MTT from January 2018 to December 2022. Radiomic features representing global tumor regions (GTRs) and ITH were extracted from pretreatment CT scans. A composite GTR-ITH score was generated using principal component analysis to integrate both GTR- and ITH-related features. Ensemble learning with multiple machine learning algorithms was employed to predict treatment response. Model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Following feature selection, 17 GTR- and 27 ITH-related radiomic features were retained to construct the GTR-ITH score. The model demonstrated high discriminative performance, with AUCs of 0.94 in the training set, 0.82 in the internal validation set, and 0.83 in the independent test set. The GTR-ITH score was strongly associated with treatment response (OR: 34.39; p<0.001) and independently predicted overall survival (HR: 0.63; p=0.004). Patients classified as GTR-ITH low-risk consistently showed significantly prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival. To reveal the biological relevance of the radiomic score, immune infiltration patterns were characterized using bulk RNA sequencing data from the Cancer Imaging Archive. The GTR-ITH low-risk group also exhibited an immune-inflamed microenvironment characterized by enriched plasma cells and M1 macrophages, and reduced M2 macrophage infiltration.
An imaging radiomic biomarker that captures both global and intratumoral heterogeneity robustly predicts response and survival in patients with HCC treated with TACE-ICI-MTT, and reflects underlying immune microenvironment phenotypes.","biomarker"", ""carcinoma"", ""chemoembolization therapeutic"", ""combined modality therapy"", ""hepatocellular"", ""immunotherapy"", ""molecular targeted therapy"", ""radiomics"", ""therapeutic",2025-11-10

19176549",Decoding ancestry-specific genetic risk: interpretable deep feature selection reveals prostate cancer SNP disparities in diverse populations.,"The clinical potential of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis has been extensively explored using conventional statistical and machine learning approaches. However, the predictive power and interpretability of these methods remain inadequate for clinical translation, primarily due to limited generalization across high-dimensional SNP datasets. This study addresses the contested diagnostic utility of SNPs by integrating interpretable feature selection with deep learning to enhance both classification performance and biological relevance.
We propose an interpretable deep feature selection framework designed to enhance both the classification performance and biological relevance of SNP markers in distinguishing between benign and malignant prostate cancer samples. This study specifically investigates the debated diagnostic value of SNPs in PCa classification by integrating feature selection with deep learning to uncover actionable insights. Specifically, our framework comprises four key components: (1) Heuristic feature reduction, which eliminates irrelevant SNPs during gradient computation for training deep neural networks (DNNs); (2) Iterative SNP subset optimization, aiming at maximizing classification AUC during model training; (3) Gradient variance minimization, mitigating instability caused by limited sample sizes; and (4) Nonlinear interaction modeling, which extracts high-level SNP interactions through hierarchical representations.
Evaluated on the PLCO, BPC3, and MEC-AA datasets, our method achieved mean AUC scores of 0.747, 0.751, and 0.559, respectively, demonstrating statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05, a paired t-test) over existing approaches. Notably, the lower AUC for MEC-AA may reflect inherent population-specific complexities, as this dataset focuses on African American men, a group historically underrepresented in genomic studies. For interpretability, our framework identified 345, 373, and 437 consensus SNP markers across the PLCO, BPC3, and MEC-AA cohorts, respectively. Key SNPs were further validated against prior research on PCa racial disparities: rs10086908 and rs2273669 (PLCO); rs12284087, rs902774, rs9364554, and rs7611694 (BPC3); and rs3123078 and rs1447295 (MEC-AA) exhibited strong concordance with established loci linked to ethnic-specific risk profiles. For instance, rs1447295 on chromosome 8q24, recurrently associated with African ancestry, underscores the method's ability to recover population-relevant variants.
By synergizing interpretable feature selection with deep learning, this work advances the translation of SNP-based biomarkers into clinically actionable tools while clarifying their contested diagnostic role in PCa.","GWAS"", ""Germline SNP markers"", ""Interpretable deep learning"", ""Prostate cancer"", ""Racial disparities",2025-09-30

31605605",A multi-omics integration framework using multi-label guided learning and multi-scale fusion.,"The rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has generated vast amounts of omics data, making multi-omics integration a crucial approach for understanding complex diseases. Despite the introduction of various multi-omics integration methods in recent years, existing approaches still have limitations, primarily in their reliance on manual feature selection, restricted applicability, and inability to comprehensively capture both inter-sample and cross-omics interactions. To address these challenges, we propose mmMOI, an end-to-end multi-omics integration framework that incorporates multi-label guided learning and multi-scale attention fusion. mmMOI directly processes raw high-dimensional omics data without requiring manual feature selection, thereby enhancing model interpretability and eliminating biases introduced by feature preselection. First, we introduce a multi-label guided multi-view graph neural network, which enables the model to adaptively learn omics data representations across different datasets, thereby improving generalizability and stability. Second, we design a multi-scale attention fusion network, which integrates global attention and local attention. This dual-attention mechanism allows mmMOI to more accurately integrate multi-omics data, enhance cross-omics feature representations, and improve classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that mmMOI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks, exhibiting high stability and adaptability across diverse biological contexts and sequencing technologies. Additionally, mmMOI successfully identifies key disease-associated biomarkers, further enhancing its biological interpretability and practical relevance. The source code, datasets, and detailed hyperparameter configurations for mmMOI are available at https://github.com/mlcb-jlu/mmMOI.","graph neural network"", ""multi-label guided learning"", ""multi-omics integration"", ""multi-scale fusion",2025-09-25

15244698","ACG-SFE: Adaptive cluster-guided simple, fast, and efficient feature selection for high-dimensional microarray data in binary classification.","Advances in data collection have resulted in an exponential growth of high-dimensional microarray datasets for binary classification in bioinformatics and medical diagnostics. These datasets generally possess many features but relatively few samples, resulting in challenges associated with the ""curse of dimensionality"", such as feature redundancy and an elevated risk of overfitting. While traditional feature selection approaches, such as filter-based and wrapper-based approaches, can help to reduce dimensionality, they often struggle to capture feature interactions while adequately preserving model generalization. Therefore, this paper introduces the Adaptive Cluster-Guided Simple, Fast, and Efficient (ACG-SFE) feature selection, a hybrid approach designed to address the challenges of high-dimensional microarray data in binary classification. ACG-SFE enhances the Simple, Fast, and Efficient (SFE) evolutionary feature selection model by integrating hierarchical clustering to dynamically group correlated features based on the optimal number of clusters determined by the Silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin score, and the feature-to-observation ratio while adaptively selecting representative features within clusters using mutual information and adjusting the selection threshold through a progress factor. This hybrid filter-wrapper approach improves feature interactions, effectively minimizing redundancy and overfitting while enhancing classification performance. The proposed model is assessed against four state-of-the-art evolutionary feature selection models on 11 high-dimensional microarray datasets. Experimental results indicate that ACG-SFE effectively selects a small yet pertinent feature subset, minimizing redundancy while attaining enhanced classification accuracy and F-measure. Furthermore, its reduced RMSE between train and test accuracy substantiates its capability to reduce overfitting, outperforming comparative models. These findings establish ACG-SFE as an effective feature selection model for handling high-dimensional microarray data in binary classification, enhancing classification accuracy while selecting minimal relevant features to reduce unnecessary complexity and the risk of overfitting.","graph neural network"", ""multi-label guided learning"", ""multi-omics integration"", ""multi-scale fusion",2025-09-08

35273156",Boosting data interpretation with GIBOOST to enhance visualization of complex high-dimensional data.,"High-dimensional single-cell data analysis is crucial for understanding complex biological interactions, yet conventional dimensionality reduction methods (DRMs) often fail to preserve both global and local structures. Existing DRMs, such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding (PHATE), optimize different visualization objectives, resulting in trade-offs between cluster separability, spatial organization, and temporal coherence. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GIBOOST, an AI-driven framework that integrates outputs from multiple DRMs using a Bayesian framework and an optimized autoencoder. GIBOOST systematically selects and integrates the two most informative DRMs by evaluating key visualization features, including separability, spatial continuity, uniformity, cellular dynamics, and cluster sensitivity. Rather than prioritizing a single DRM, it identifies the optimal combination that maximizes clustering sensitivity (GI) while preserving biologically relevant spatial and temporal structures. This integration is further refined through a GI-optimized autoencoder, which optimizes the joint distribution of GI, neuron count, and batch size effects to improve visualization quality. We demonstrate GIBOOST's efficacy across multiple dynamic biological processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, CiPSC reprogramming, spermatogenesis, and placental development. Compared to nine individual DRMs, GIBOOST enhances clustering sensitivity and biological relevance by ~30%, enabling more accurate interpretation of differentiation trajectories and cell-cell interactions. When applied to a large single-cell RNA-seq dataset (~400 000 cells, 28 cell types, seven placental regions), GIBOOST uncovers novel immune-placenta interactions, providing deeper insights into cross-tissue communication during pregnancy. By improving both the visualization and interpretability of high-dimensional data, GIBOOST serves as a powerful tool for computational systems biology, enabling a more accurate exploration of complex cellular systems.","AI-driven data integration"", ""cell–cell communication"", ""data visualization"", ""dimensionality reduction"", ""immune-placental interactions"", ""single-cell analysis",2025-08-26

25266848",Random Walk-Based Node Feature Learning for Major Depressive Disorder Identification Through Multi-Site rs-fMRI Data.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a globally prevalent psychiatric disorder that significantly impairs quality of life and increases suicide risk. Accurate identification of MDD is critical for clinically assisted diagnosis. Although substantial progress has been made in MDD identification, extracting region of interest (ROI) features from functional brain networks remains underexplored. Furthermore, most studies rely on small-scale resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) datasets, which limits the generalizability of their findings to large-scale brain networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel graph embedding-based feature selection classification framework (GEF-FSC) to identify MDD through multi-site rs-fMRI data. The framework employs the node2vec algorithm to learn local and global functional connectivity (FC) features of ROIs via flexible random walks, capturing structural information in functional brain networks. Random Forest is then applied for feature selection on the learned embedding features, followed by classification using an ensemble classifier. This approach captures complex, higher-order structural information between ROIs and retains important features, enhancing classification accuracy by minimizing redundancy in high-dimensional FC features. Evaluated on the REST-meta-MDD dataset, our framework achieved 81.65% accuracy under the Dosenbach template and 75.30% under the AAL atlas. Comparative experiments with eight benchmark methods and six state-of-the-art classifiers demonstrated superior accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Interpretability analysis highlighted key brain regions and networks consistent with previous findings. The GEF-FSC framework effectively classifies MDD and identifies key brain regions and networks associated with the disorder, emphasizing the importance of higher-order structural information in improving diagnostic accuracy.","ensemble learning"", ""functional connectivity"", ""major depressive disorder"", ""node2vec"", ""random walk",2025-08-21

37985874",scGGC: a two-stage strategy for single-cell clustering through cellular gene pathway construction.,"In the last few years, there has been great advancement in the field of single-cell data investigation, particularly in the development of clustering methods. The advanced research is increased for the development of clustering algorithms tailored for single-cell RNA sequencing data. Conventional methods primarily focus on local relationships among cells or genes, while overlooking the global cell-gene interactions. As a result, the high dimensionality, noise, and sparsity of the data continue to pose significant challenges to clustering accuracy. To address the challenges of single-cell clustering analysis, we propose a novel single-cell clustering model, scGGC, which integrates graph autoencoders and generative adversarial network techniques. The innovations of scGGC include two components: (i) construction of an adjacency matrix that incorporates cell-cell and cell-gene relationships to capture complex interactions in a graph structure, enabling nonlinear dimensionality reduction and initial clustering via a graph autoencoder; (ii) enhancement of clustering performance by selecting high-confidence samples from the initial clusters for adversarial neural network training. A comprehensive evaluation on nine publicly available scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scGGC outperforms eight comparison methods. For example, on datasets such as MHC3K, the Adjusted Rand Index increases by an average of 10.1%. Furthermore, marker gene identification and cell type annotation further confirm the biological relevance of scGGC, with marker gene overlap rates exceeding 70% across multiple datasets. We conclude that scGGC not only improves the accuracy of single-cell data clustering but also enhances the identification of cell-type-specific marker genes.

35639733",Comparative analysis of statistical and deep learning-based multi-omics integration for breast cancer subtype classification.,"Breast cancer (BC) is a critical cause of cancer-related death globally. The heterogeneity of BC subtypes poses challenges in understanding molecular mechanisms, early diagnosis, and disease management. Recent studies suggest that integrating multi-omics layers can significantly enhance BC subtype identification. However, evaluating different multi-omics integration methods for BC subtyping remains ambiguous.
In this study, we conducted a multi-omics integration analysis on 960 BC patient samples, incorporating three omics layers: Host transcriptomics, epigenomics, and shotgun microbiome. We compared two integration approaches the statistical-based approach (MOFA+) and a deep learning-based approach (MOGCN) for this integration. We evaluated both methods using complementary evaluation criteria. First, we assessed the ability of selected features to discriminate between BC subtypes using both linear and nonlinear classification models. Second, we analyzed the biological relevance of the selected features to key BC pathways, focusing on transcriptomics-driven insights.
Our results showed that MOFA+ outperformed MOGCN in feature selection, achieving the highest F1 score (0.75) in the nonlinear classification model, with MOFA+ also identifying 121 relevant pathways compared to 100 from MOGCN. Notably, one of the key pathways Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis and the SNARE pathway was implicated, offering insights into immune responses and tumor progression.
These findings suggest that MOFA+ is a more effective unsupervised tool for feature selection in BC subtyping. Our study underscores the potential of multi-omics integration to improve BC subtype prediction and provides critical insights for advancing personalized medicine in BC.","Breast cancer"", ""F1 score"", ""Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis"", ""MOFA+"", ""MoGCN"", ""Multi-omics integration"", ""Network analysis"", ""Personalized Medicine"", ""SNARE pathway",2025-07-02

A feedforward attention-based deep learning model effectively selected 99 significant metabolites, outperforming traditional static methods in classification performance and biomarker consistency. By combining data from diverse platforms, the approach captured a comprehensive metabolic profile while maintaining biological relevance. Self-organizing map analysis revealed distinct metabolic signatures for each subtype, highlighting critical pathways. Group 1 (ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative) exhibited elevated serine, tyrosine, and 2-aminoadipic acid levels, indicating enhanced amino acid metabolism supporting nucleotide synthesis and redox balance. Group 3 (triple-negative breast cancer) displayed increased TCA cycle intermediates, such as α-ketoglutarate and malate, reflecting a metabolic shift toward energy production and biosynthesis to sustain aggressive proliferation. In Group 4 (HER2-enriched), elevated phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines suggested upregulated mono-unsaturated phospholipid biosynthesis. The study provides a framework for leveraging multimodal data integration, attention-based feature selection, and self-organizing map analysis to identify biologically meaningful biomarkers.","Attention-Based Deep Learning"", ""Breast Cancer Subtypes"", ""Feature Selection"", ""Metabolic Signatures"", ""Multimodal Metabolomics"", ""Random Forest"", ""SVM-RFE"", ""Self-Organizing Map"", ""XGB-RFE",2025-07-02

36709495",Identification of esophageal cancer tumor antigens and immune subtypes for guiding vaccine development.,"Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by poor prognosis, primarily due to late diagnosis and limited treatment efficacy. Immunotherapies, such as vaccines, necessitate a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment and tumor-specific antigens. The immune heterogeneity of ESCA, which is shaped by immune cell infiltration and antigen presentation, remains largely unexplored, particularly in terms of its interactions with autoimmune mechanisms. This study employs multi-omics analysis to profile the immunophenotype of ESCA, aiming to identify immune evasion mechanisms, tumor antigens, and autoimmune-related pathways. By elucidating these features, we seek to uncover potential targets for vaccine development and personalized immunotherapies, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes.
To screen for potential antigen genes, we examined the overexpressed and mutated genes specific to ESCA. Additionally, we employed Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox analysis to evaluate the prognostic relevance of these potential tumor antigens. To achieve data aggregation and construct a consistency matrix, we used consistency clustering. Subsequently, a graph learning-based dimensionality reduction method was implemented to clarify the immune subtypes. Furthermore, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to cluster potential antigen genes and identify hub genes.
Our analysis identified six overexpressed and mutated tumor antigens that were strongly associated with poor prognosis and antigen-presenting cell (APC) infiltration in ESCA. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data consistently identified three immune subtypes. These findings allowed for the construction of the immune landscape of TCGA samples based on the respective immune subtypes. The integration of immunogenomics analysis further allowed for the characterization of the immune microenvironment for each immune subtype. WGCNA successfully screened for three prognostic factors.

29470400",Description of metabolic differences between castrated males and intact gilts obtained from high-throughput metabolomics of porcine plasma.,"Surgically castrated male pigs, which are commonly produced in pork production systems, have slightly lower production efficiency, compared to intact female pigs (gilts). This is mainly due to an unfavorable feed conversion rate and fatter carcasses. These differences influenced by physiological and genetic factors can be identified through metabolomics, which describes metabolic profiles. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to analyze the plasma of 694 Italian Large White pigs (228 castrated males and 466 intact gilts), sampled at slaughter. The metabolomic profiles included 731 metabolites covering 98 sub-pathways. The raw metabolomic data were cleaned and imputed using multivariate imputation by chained equations. The Boruta algorithm was then employed to identify metabolites that have different concentrations between castrated males and intact gilts. To address the random nature of feature selection, multiple Boruta runs were generated, and nested within a 10-fold cross-validation, resulting in 1,250 Boruta datasets. These datasets helped identify 40 informative metabolites, with a reduced core of 15 metabolites consistently confirmed across all runs. Their calculated random forest out-of-bag error was 0.25 and 0.27, respectively. The relevance, ranking, and predictive ability of each selected metabolite were determined based on the mean decrease Gini (MDG) and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, with MDG values of 0.024 ± 0.007 and 0.030 ± 0.009 and AUC values of 0.62 ± 0.04 and 0.65 ± 0.03 for the 2 metabolite sets, respectively. Of the 40 selected metabolites, 60% had higher concentrations in castrated males than in intact gilts, while in the 15 metabolites set, this percentage was 80%. Network and biological pathways analyses indicated that the selected metabolites were primarily amino acids and lipids, many of which belonged to their respective sub-pathways, suggesting minimal biological differences between castrated males and intact gilts. These findings support previous results obtained using a targeted metabolomic platform. This study represents the largest investigation to date on the pig sex metabolome, providing essential biological insights that could inform precise husbandry and feeding strategies in pigs, taking into consideration the castration status of the males.
Surgically castrated male pigs are commonly produced in many pork production systems, including Italy. Castrated males have slightly lower production efficiency, compared to intact female pigs (gilts), mainly due to an unfavorable feed conversion rate and fatter carcasses. These differences are influenced in part by the diverse hormonal state of the animals and in part by the genetic component, derived from the XY and XX chromosomal composition of males and females. At the molecular level, these differences can be identified through metabolomics, which describes the metabolic profiles of the pigs. In this study, we compared the plasma of Italian Large White castrated males and intact gilts. Data from about 700 metabolites were statistically elaborated using a pipeline that filtered samples and metabolites, performed missing data imputation, and conducted feature selection with machine learning approaches. A total of 40 metabolites were identified to discriminate the metabolomic profiles of castrated males versus intact gilts. Most of these informative metabolites are amino acids and lipids involved in the same respective biochemical pathways. This study may provide essential biological insights that could inform precise husbandry and feeding strategies in pigs, taking into consideration the castration status of the males.","Sus scrofa"", ""castration"", ""machine learning"", ""metabolite"", ""pig"", ""plasma",2025-05-23

31269290",Role of circulating MicroRNAs in prostate cancer diagnosis and risk stratification in the MCC Spain study.,"To identify circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with prostate cancer and to develop predictive models capable of distinguishing cases from controls and stratifying patients by Gleason risk categories (low, intermediate, and high risk). This case-control study included 203 prostate cancer cases and 54 population-based controls. Serum samples were analyzed by RT-qPCR (performed at QIAGEN Genomic Services). Total RNA was extracted from 200 µl of serum using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Advanced Kit and reverse-transcribed with the miRCURY LNA RT Kit. A panel of 46 candidate miRNAs was profiled, and feature selection was performed using LASSO penalization. Logistic regression models were used to estimate age- and covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between miRNA expression and prostate cancer risk. Predictive performance was assessed using repeated 5-fold cross-validation with bootstrap resampling (10 repetitions; 1000 resamples), and summarized using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with bias-corrected 95% CIs. Fourteen miRNAs were significantly associated with prostate cancer. Notably, miR-199a-5p (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13-3.15; p = 0.015) and miR-150-5p (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06-0.63; p = 0.006) showed consistent differential expression across all Gleason risk categories, with miR-199a-5p overexpressed and miR-150-5p underexpressed, suggesting a potential role in disease progression. miR-145-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-93-5p were significantly associated with prostate cancer in both the overall model and in low- and intermediate-risk strata, highlighting their potential relevance in early-stage disease. In contrast, miR-24-3p was exclusively overexpressed in high-risk prostate cancer (OR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.43-5.98; p = 0.003), indicating a possible link with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Predictive models demonstrated strong discriminatory performance, particularly for the low-risk group (AUC = 0.930, 95% CI: 0.882-0.979), followed by the intermediate-risk (AUC = 0.806, 95% CI: 0.728-0.883) and high-risk groups (AUC = 0.752, 95% CI: 0.658-0.848). The overall model achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.756-0.892), reflecting robust performance in distinguishing cases from controls. This study identifies key circulating miRNAs associated with prostate cancer and demonstrates their potential in predictive models for risk stratification. The strongest discriminatory performance was observed in low-risk tumors (AUC = 0.930), followed by intermediate- (AUC = 0.806) and high-risk (AUC = 0.752) categories. These findings support the use of miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and personalized management of prostate cancer.","Diagnosis"", ""Gleason score"", ""MiRNA"", ""Prostate cancer"", ""Risk stratification",2025-05-21

22,40118356,Uncovering hidden subtypes in dementia: An unsupervised machine learning approach to dementia diagnosis and personalization of care.,"Dementia represents a growing public health challenge, affecting an increasing number of individuals. It encompasses a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments, ranging from mild to severe stages, each of which demands varying levels of care. Current diagnostic approaches often treat dementia as a uniform condition, potentially overlooking clinically significant subtypes, which limits the effectiveness of treatment and care strategies. This study seeks to address the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods by applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to a large, multi-modal dataset of dementia patients (encompassing multiple data sources including clinical, demographic, gene expression and protein concentrations), with the aim of identifying distinct subtypes within the population. The primary focus is on differentiating between mild and severe stages of dementia to improve diagnostic accuracy and personalize treatment plans.
The dataset analyzed included 911 individuals, described by 157 multi-modal characteristics, encompassing clinical, genomic, proteomic and sociodemographic features. After handling missing data, the dataset was reduced to 561 rows and 135 columns. Various dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to improve the feature-to-patient ratio, and unsupervised clustering methods were employed to identify potential subtypes. The major novelty in our methodology regards the combination of different techniques, bridging high-dimensional statistical inference, multi-modal dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis, to appropriately model the multi-modal nature of the data and ensure clinical relevance.
The analysis revealed distinct clusters within the dementia population, each characterized by specific clinical and demographic profiles. These profiles included variations in biomarkers, cognitive scores, and disability levels. The findings suggest the presence of previously unrecognized subgroups, distinguished by their genomic, proteomic, and clinical characteristics.
This study demonstrates that unsupervised machine learning can effectively identify clinically relevant subtypes of dementia, with important implications for diagnosis and personalized treatment. Further research is required to validate these findings and investigate their potential to improve patient outcomes.","Clustering"", ""Dementia"", ""Multimodal data"", ""Unsupervised learning",2025-03-22
23,40068177,Spatial and single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals fibroblasts dependent immune environment in colorectal cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits a complex tumor microenvironment with significant cellular heterogeneity, particularly involving cancer-associated fibroblasts that influence tumor behavior and metastasis. This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to dissect fibroblast heterogeneity in CRC. Data processing employed Seurat for quality control, principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding for visualization. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2. Immune infiltration was assessed via Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, CIBERSORT, and xCell algorithms. Prognostic genes were identified through univariate Cox regression, followed by consensus clustering and survival analysis. Metabolic pathways were explored using scMetabolism. Experimental validation involved CCK8, scratch, and Transwell assays to evaluate the roles of key genes BGN and CERCAM in CRC cell proliferation and metastasis. Machine learning-driven analysis identified four fibroblast-associated genes (TRIP6, TIMP1, BGN, and CERCAM) demonstrating significant prognostic relevance in CRC. Consensus clustering based on these biomarkers stratified CRC patients into three distinct molecular subtypes (Clusters A-C). Notably, Cluster C exhibited the most unfavorable clinical outcomes coupled with marked upregulation of all four fibroblast-related genes. Comprehensive immune profiling revealed paradoxical features in Cluster C: heightened global immune activation (characterized by substantial leukocyte infiltration) coexisted with specific immunosuppressive elements, including significant enrichment of pro-tumorigenic M0 macrophages, depletion of anti-tumor plasma cells, and resting memory CD4+ T cells, along with coordinated upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules. Computational prediction using the TIDE platform suggested enhanced immunotherapy responsiveness in Cluster C patients. Functional validation demonstrated that knockdown of BGN or CERCAM significantly impaired malignant phenotypes, reducing proliferative capacity, migration potential, and invasive ability. Fibroblasts demonstrate significant heterogeneity within the CRC immune microenvironment, impacting prognosis and therapeutic responses. Key genes BGN and CERCAM emerge as potential immunotherapeutic targets, offering new strategies for precision treatment of CRC.","colorectal cancer"", ""fibroblasts"", ""immune environment"", ""single cell transcriptome"", ""spatial transcriptome",2025-03-12

28706271",RCE-IFE: recursive cluster elimination with intra-cluster feature elimination.,"The computational and interpretational difficulties caused by the ever-increasing dimensionality of biological data generated by new technologies pose a significant challenge. Feature selection (FS) methods aim to reduce the dimension, and feature grouping has emerged as a foundation for FS techniques that seek to detect strong correlations among features and identify irrelevant features. In this work, we propose the Recursive Cluster Elimination with Intra-Cluster Feature Elimination (RCE-IFE) method that utilizes feature grouping and iterates grouping and elimination steps in a supervised context. We assess dimensionality reduction and discriminatory capabilities of RCE-IFE on various high-dimensional datasets from different biological domains. For a set of gene expression, microRNA (miRNA) expression, and methylation datasets, the performance of RCE-IFE is comparatively evaluated with RCE-IFE-SVM (the SVM-adapted version of RCE-IFE) and SVM-RCE. On average, RCE-IFE attains an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 among tested expression datasets with the fewest features and the shortest running time, while RCE-IFE-SVM (the SVM-adapted version of RCE-IFE) and SVM-RCE achieve similar AUCs of 0.84 and 0.83, respectively. RCE-IFE and SVM-RCE yield AUCs of 0.79 and 0.68, respectively when averaged over seven different metagenomics datasets, with RCE-IFE significantly reducing feature subsets. Furthermore, RCE-IFE surpasses several state-of-the-art FS methods, such as Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF), Information Gain (IG), Conditional Mutual Information Maximization (CMIM), SelectKBest (SKB), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), obtaining an average AUC of 0.76 on five gene expression datasets. Compared with a similar tool, Multi-stage, RCE-IFE gives a similar average accuracy rate of 89.27% using fewer features on four cancer-related datasets. The comparability of RCE-IFE is also verified with other biological domain knowledge-based Grouping-Scoring-Modeling (G-S-M) tools, including mirGediNET, 3Mint, and miRcorrNet. Additionally, the biological relevance of the selected features by RCE-IFE is evaluated. The proposed method also exhibits high consistency in terms of the selected features across multiple runs. Our experimental findings imply that RCE-IFE provides robust classifier performance and significantly reduces feature size while maintaining feature relevance and consistency.","Disease"", ""Feature grouping"", ""Feature selection"", ""Intra-cluster feature elimination"", ""Recursive cluster elimination",2025-03-10

10625534",Atherosclerotic plaque instability in symptomatic non-significant carotid stenoses.,"Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis is recommended for patients with >70% stenosis, but not in those with <50%. Because non-significant, low-degree stenoses may still cause strokes, refined risk stratification is necessary, which could be improved by assessing biological features of plaque instability. To challenge risk-stratification based on luminal narrowing, we compared biological features of carotid plaques from symptomatic patients with low-degree (<50%) vs high-degree (>70%) stenosis and explored potential mechanisms behind plaque instability in low-degree stenoses.
Endarterectomy specimens were taken from symptomatic patients with high-degree (n = 204) and low-degree (n = 34) stenosis, all part of the Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies. Patient demographics, image-derived plaque morphology, and gene expression analyses of extracted lesions were used for comparisons. Plaque biology was assessed by transcriptomics using dimensionality reduction, differential gene expression, and gene-set enrichment analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to study proteins corresponding to upregulated genes.
The demographics of the two groups were statistically similar. Calcification, lipid-rich necrotic core, intraplaque hemorrhage, plaque burden, and fibrous cap thickness were similar in both groups, whereas the sum of lipid-rich necrotic core and intraplaque hemorrhage was higher (
Plaques from symptomatic patients with non-significant low-degree carotid stenoses showed morphologic and biological features of atherosclerotic plaque instability that were comparable to plaques from patients with high-degree stenoses, emphasizing the need for improved stroke risk stratification for intervention in all patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis irrespective of luminal narrowing. An increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 3A in low-degree stenotic lesions suggested mechanisms of plaque instability associated with tissue hypoxia and plaque angiogenesis, but the exact role of hypoxia-inducible factor 3A in this process remains to be determined.
Carotid plaques from symptomatic patients with <50% stenosis show morphologic and biological features of plaque instability, comparable to high-degree stenosis, which emphasizes the need for improved stroke risk stratification beyond stenosis severity.","Atherosclerotic plaque instability"", ""Degree of stenosis"", ""Hypoxia"", ""Stroke risk"", ""Symptomatic carotid stenosis",2025-03-04

This processing may provide scaling issues that limit the implementation of these types of data into research as well as integrated diagnostics in routine care. Here, we investigate whether we can use existing dimension reduction techniques to provide visualisations and analyses for a complete bloodcount (CBC) while maintaining representativeness of the original data. We considered over 3 million CBC measurements encompassing over 70 parameters of cell frequency, size and complexity from the UMC Utrecht UPOD database. We evaluated PCA as an example of a linear dimension reduction techniques and UMAP, TriMap and PaCMAP as non-linear dimension reduction techniques. We assessed their technical performance using quality metrics for dimension reduction as well as biological representation by evaluating preservation of diurnal, age and sex patterns, cluster preservation and the identification of leukemia patients.
We found that, for clinical hematology data, PCA performs systematically better than UMAP, TriMap and PaCMAP in representing the underlying data. Biological relevance was retained for periodicity in the data. However, we also observed a decrease in predictive performance of the reduced data for both age and sex, as well as an overestimation of clusters within the reduced data. Finally, we were able to identify the diverging patterns for leukemia patients after use of dimensionality reduction methods.
We conclude that for hematology data, the use of unsupervised dimension reduction techniques should be limited to data visualization applications, as implementing them in diagnostic pipelines may lead to decreased quality of integrated diagnostics in routine care.","Clustering"", ""Data preservation"", ""Dimension reduction"", ""Haematology"", ""Routine care data",2025-02-13
27,39847951,Identifying candidate RNA-seq biomarkers for severity discrimination in chemical injuries: A machine learning and molecular dynamics approach.,"Biomarkers play a crucial role across various fields by providing insights into biological responses to interventions. High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies facilitate the discovery of data-driven biomarkers through extensive datasets. This study focuses on identifying biomarkers in gene expression data related to chemical injuries by mustard gas, covering a spectrum from healthy individuals to severe injuries.
The study utilized RNA-Seq data comprising 52 expression data samples for 54,583 gene transcripts. These samples were categorized into four classes based on the GOLD classification for chemically injured individuals: Severe (n = 14), Moderate (n = 11), Mild (n = 16), and healthy controls (n = 11). Data preparation involved examining an Excel file created in the R programming environment using MLSeq and devtools packages. Feature selection was performed using Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, with Random Forest algorithm employed for classification. Ab initio methods ensured computational efficiency and result accuracy, while molecular dynamics simulation acted as a virtual experiment bridging the gap between experimental and theoretical experiences.
A total of 12 models were created, each introducing a list of differentially expressed genes as potential biomarkers. The performance of models varied across group comparisons, with the Genetic Algorithm generally outperforming Simulated Annealing in most cases. For the Severe vs. Moderate group, GA achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 94.38%, recall of 91.64%, and specificity of 97.10%. The results highlight the effectiveness of GA in most group comparisons, while SA performed better in specific cases involving Moderate and Mild groups. These biomarkers were evaluated against the gene expression data to assess their expression changes between different groups of chemically injured individuals. Four genes were selected based on level expression for further investigation: CXCR1, EIF2B2, RAD51, and RXFP2. The expression levels of these genes were analyzed to determine their differential expression between the groups.
This study was designed as a computational effort to identify diagnostic biomarkers in basic biological system research. Our findings proposed a list of discriminative biomarkers capable of distinguishing between different groups of chemically injured individuals. The identification of key genes highlights the potential for biomarkers to serve as indicators of chemical injury severity, warranting further investigation to validate their clinical relevance and utility in diagnosis and treatment.","Biomarkers"", ""Chemical injured"", ""Machine Learning"", ""Mustard Gas"", ""RNA-Seq",2025-01-24

36371443",Predicting prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma by predicting TIGIT expression: a pathomics model.,"Traditional diagnostic methods have limited efficacy in predicting the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) is a new biomarker. This study aimed to evaluate TIGIT expression as a LUAD biomarker and predict patient prognosis using a pathological feature model.
Clinical data and pathological images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. The prognostic value of TIGIT was verified by genetic prognostic analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The OTSU algorithm was used to segment LUAD pathological images, and features were extracted using the PyRadiomics package and standardized with z-scores. Feature selection was performed using min-redundancy, recursive feature elimination (RFE) and stepwise regression algorithms, and a logistic regression algorithm was used to establish the pathomics model. Receiver operating characteristics, calibration, and decision curves were used for model evaluation. The pathomics score (PS) was used to predict TIGIT gene expression and analyze prognostic value and pathological mechanisms through Spearman correlation.
The study included 443 clinical samples and 327 pathological images. Prognostic analysis showed significantly higher TIGIT expression in tumor tissues (P<0.001), with TIGIT being a protective factor for overall survival (OS) in LUAD [hazard ratio (HR) =0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-0.95; P=0.03]. GSEA revealed significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the TGF-β and MAPK signaling pathways. From 465 pathological features, the four best features were selected to construct a pathomics model with good predictive performance. Higher PS values were observed in the TIGIT high-expression group, correlating with improved OS (P=0.009). PS was positively correlated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition related (EMT-related) genes (

29,39121059,Glypred: Lysine Glycation Site Prediction via CCU-LightGBM-BiLSTM Framework with Multi-Head Attention Mechanism.,"Glycation, a type of posttranslational modification, preferentially occurs on lysine and arginine residues, impairing protein functionality and altering characteristics. This process is linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Traditional wet lab experiments are time-consuming, whereas machine learning has significantly streamlined the prediction of protein glycation sites. Despite promising results, challenges remain, including data imbalance, feature redundancy, and suboptimal classifier performance. This research introduces Glypred, a lysine glycation site prediction model combining ClusterCentroids Undersampling (CCU), LightGBM, and bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) methodologies, with an additional multihead attention mechanism integrated into the BiLSTM. To achieve this, the study undertakes several key steps: selecting diverse feature types to capture comprehensive protein information, employing a cluster-based undersampling strategy to balance the data set, using LightGBM for feature selection to enhance model performance, and implementing a bidirectional LSTM network for accurate classification. Together, these approaches ensure that Glypred effectively identifies glycation sites with high accuracy and robustness. For feature encoding, five distinct feature types─AAC, KMER, DR, PWAA, and EBGW─were selected to capture a broad spectrum of protein sequence and biological information. These encoded features were integrated and validated to ensure comprehensive protein information acquisition. To address the issue of highly imbalanced positive and negative samples, various undersampling algorithms, including random undersampling, NearMiss, edited nearest neighbor rule, and CCU, were evaluated. CCU was ultimately chosen to remove redundant nonglycated training data, establishing a balanced data set that enhances the model's accuracy and robustness. For feature selection, the LightGBM ensemble learning algorithm was employed to reduce feature dimensionality by identifying the most significant features. This approach accelerates model training, enhances generalization capabilities, and ensures good transferability of the model. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network was used as the classifier, with a network structure designed to capture glycation modification site features from both forward and backward directions. To prevent overfitting, appropriate regularization parameters and dropout rates were introduced, achieving efficient classification. Experimental results show that Glypred achieved optimal performance. This model provides new insights for bioinformatics and encourages the application of similar strategies in other fields. A lysine glycation site prediction software tool was also developed using the PyQt5 library, offering researchers an auxiliary screening tool to reduce workload and improve efficiency.

29625055",COPS: A novel platform for multi-omic disease subtype discovery via robust multi-objective evaluation of clustering algorithms.,"Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Furthermore, current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in the methodology. We present the COPS R-package, tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. Some of these methods are not accessible through R, and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics, they vary considerably across methods and datasets. Therefore, it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets. Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies.","T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT)"", ""lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)"", ""mechanisms of pathology"", ""pathomics"", ""prognostic model",2024-08-05

35651615",Elucidating the multifaceted roles of GPR146 in non-specific orbital inflammation: a concerted analytical approach through the prisms of bioinformatics and machine learning.,"Non-specific Orbital Inflammation (NSOI) is a chronic idiopathic condition marked by extensive polymorphic lymphoid infiltration in the orbital area. The integration of metabolic and immune pathways suggests potential therapeutic roles for C-peptide and G protein-coupled receptor 146 (GPR146) in diabetes and its sequelae. However, the specific mechanisms through which GPR146 modulates immune responses remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the utility of GPR146 as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for NSOI has not been conclusively demonstrated.
We adopted a comprehensive analytical strategy, merging differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE58331 and GSE105149 with immune-related genes from the ImmPort database. Our methodology combined LASSO regression and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) for feature selection, followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) to explore gene sets co-expressed with GPR146, identifying a significant enrichment in immune-related pathways. The tumor microenvironment's immune composition was quantified using the CIBERSORT algorithm and the ESTIMATE method, which confirmed a positive correlation between GPR146 expression and immune cell infiltration. Validation of GPR146 expression was performed using the GSE58331 dataset.
Analysis identified 113 DEGs associated with GPR146, with a significant subset showing distinct expression patterns. Using LASSO and SVM-RFE, we pinpointed 15 key hub genes. Functionally, these genes and GPR146 were predominantly linked to receptor ligand activity, immune receptor activity, and cytokine-mediated signaling. Specific immune cells, such as memory B cells, M2 macrophages, resting mast cells, monocytes, activated NK cells, plasma cells, and CD8+ T cells, were positively associated with GPR146 expression. In contrast, M0 macrophages, naive B cells, M1 macrophages, activated mast cells, activated memory CD4+ T cells, naive CD4+ T cells, and gamma delta T cells showed inverse correlations. Notably, our findings underscore the potential diagnostic relevance of GPR146 in distinguishing NSOI.
Our study elucidates the immunological signatures associated with GPR146 in the context of NSOI, highlighting its prognostic and diagnostic potential. These insights pave the way for GPR146 to be a novel biomarker for monitoring the progression of NSOI, providing a foundation for future therapeutic strategies targeting immune-metabolic pathways.","GPR146"", ""LASSO regression"", ""SVM-RFE"", ""autoimmune inflammatory disorder"", ""non-specific orbital inflammation (NSOI)",2024-06-21

24316577",Improving the performance and interpretability on medical datasets using graphical ensemble feature selection.,"A major hindrance towards using Machine Learning (ML) on medical datasets is the discrepancy between a large number of variables and small sample sizes. While multiple feature selection techniques have been proposed to avoid the resulting overfitting, overall ensemble techniques offer the best selection robustness. Yet, current methods designed to combine different algorithms generally fail to leverage the dependencies identified by their components. Here, we propose Graphical Ensembling (GE), a graph-theory-based ensemble feature selection technique designed to improve the stability and relevance of the selected features.
Relying on four datasets, we show that GE increases classification performance with fewer selected features. For example, on rheumatoid arthritis patient stratification, GE outperforms the baseline methods by 9% Balanced Accuracy while relying on fewer features. We use data on sub-cellular networks to show that the selected features (proteins) are closer to the known disease genes, and the uncovered biological mechanisms are more diversified. By successfully tackling the complex correlations between biological variables, we anticipate that GE will improve the medical applications of ML.

32324581",Optimizing Outcomes in Psychotherapy for Anxiety Disorders Using Smartphone-Based and Passive Sensing Features: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), currently have the strongest evidence of durable symptom changes for most psychological disorders, such as anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, only about half of individuals treated with CBT benefit from it. Predictive algorithms, including digital assessments and passive sensing features, could better identify patients who would benefit from CBT, and thus, improve treatment choices.
This study aims to establish predictive features that forecast responses to transdiagnostic CBT in anxiety disorders and to investigate key mechanisms underlying treatment responses.
This study is a 2-armed randomized controlled clinical trial. We include patients with anxiety disorders who are randomized to either a transdiagnostic CBT group or a waitlist (referred to as WAIT). We index key features to predict responses prior to starting treatment using subjective self-report questionnaires, experimental tasks, biological samples, ecological momentary assessments, activity tracking, and smartphone-based passive sensing to derive a multimodal feature set for predictive modeling. Additional assessments take place weekly at mid- and posttreatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups to index anxiety and depression symptom severity. We aim to include 150 patients, randomized to CBT versus WAIT at a 3:1 ratio. The data set will be subject to full feature and important features selected by minimal redundancy and maximal relevance feature selection and then fed into machine leaning models, including eXtreme gradient boosting, pattern recognition network, and k-nearest neighbors to forecast treatment response. The performance of the developed models will be evaluated. In addition to predictive modeling, we will test specific mechanistic hypotheses (eg, association between self-efficacy, daily symptoms obtained using ecological momentary assessments, and treatment response) to elucidate mechanisms underlying treatment response.
The trial is now completed. It was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee, Zurich. The results will be disseminated through publications in scientific peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.
The aim of this trial is to improve current CBT treatment by precise forecasting of treatment response and by understanding and potentially augmenting underpinning mechanisms and personalizing treatment.

34,38658129,Stable feature selection utilizing Graph Convolutional Neural Network and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for biomarker discovery in breast cancer.,"High-throughput technologies are becoming increasingly important in discovering prognostic biomarkers and in identifying novel drug targets. With Mammaprint, Oncotype DX, and many other prognostic molecular signatures breast cancer is one of the paradigmatic examples of the utility of high-throughput data to deliver prognostic biomarkers, that can be represented in a form of a rather short gene list. Such gene lists can be obtained as a set of features (genes) that are important for the decisions of a Machine Learning (ML) method applied to high-dimensional gene expression data. Several studies have identified predictive gene lists for patient prognosis in breast cancer, but these lists are unstable and have only a few genes in common. Instability of feature selection impedes biological interpretability: genes that are relevant for cancer pathology should be members of any predictive gene list obtained for the same clinical type of patients. Stability and interpretability of selected features can be improved by including information on molecular networks in ML methods. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) is a contemporary deep learning approach applicable to gene expression data structured by a prior knowledge molecular network. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are methods to explain individual decisions of deep learning models. We used both GCNN+LRP and GCNN+SHAP techniques to construct feature sets by aggregating individual explanations. We suggest a methodology to systematically and quantitatively analyze the stability, the impact on the classification performance, and the interpretability of the selected feature sets. We used this methodology to compare GCNN+LRP to GCNN+SHAP and to more classical ML-based feature selection approaches. Utilizing a large breast cancer gene expression dataset we show that, while feature selection with SHAP is useful in applications where selected features have to be impactful for classification performance, among all studied methods GCNN+LRP delivers the most stable (reproducible) and interpretable gene lists.","Classification of cancer"", ""Deep learning on graphs"", ""Explainable AI"", ""Feature selection"", ""Gene expression data"", ""Interpretability"", ""Molecular networks"", ""Prior knowledge"", ""Stability",2024-04-25

Existing unsupervised feature selection algorithms primarily focus on the significance of features in maintaining the data structure while not taking into account the redundancy among features. Determining the appropriate number of significant features is another challenge.
In this paper, we propose a clustering-guided unsupervised feature selection (CGUFS) algorithm for gene expression data that addresses these problems. Our proposed algorithm introduces three improvements over existing algorithms. For the problem that existing clustering algorithms require artificially specifying the number of clusters, we propose an adaptive 
Experimental results show that the average accuracy (ACC) and matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) indexes of the C4.5 classifier on the optimal features selected by the CGUFS algorithm reach 74.37% and 63.84%, respectively, significantly superior to the existing algorithms.
Similarly, the average ACC and MCC indexes of the Adaboost classifier on the optimal features selected by the CGUFS algorithm are significantly superior to the existing algorithms.

33945538",A hybrid feature selection algorithm combining information gain and grouping particle swarm optimization for cancer diagnosis.,"Cancer diagnosis based on machine learning has become a popular application direction. Support vector machine (SVM), as a classical machine learning algorithm, has been widely used in cancer diagnosis because of its advantages in high-dimensional and small sample data. However, due to the high-dimensional feature space and high feature redundancy of gene expression data, SVM faces the problem of poor classification effect when dealing with such data.
Based on this, this paper proposes a hybrid feature selection algorithm combining information gain and grouping particle swarm optimization (IG-GPSO). The algorithm firstly calculates the information gain values of the features and ranks them in descending order according to the value. Then, ranked features are grouped according to the information index, so that the features in the group are close, and the features outside the group are sparse. Finally, grouped features are searched using grouping PSO and evaluated according to in-group and out-group.
Experimental results show that the average accuracy (ACC) of the SVM on the feature subset selected by the IG-GPSO is 98.50%, which is significantly better than the traditional feature selection algorithm. Compared with KNN, the classification effect of the feature subset selected by the IG-GPSO is still optimal. In addition, the results of multiple comparison tests show that the feature selection effect of the IG-GPSO is significantly better than that of traditional feature selection algorithms.
The feature subset selected by IG-GPSO not only has the best classification effect, but also has the least feature scale (FS). More importantly, the IG-GPSO significantly improves the ACC of SVM in cancer diagnostic.","Clustering-guided"", ""Gene expression data"", ""Spectral clustering"", ""Unsupervised feature selection"", ""k-means",2024-03-11
37,38459654,Navigating colorectal cancer prognosis: A Treg-related signature discovered through single-cell and bulk transcriptomic approaches.,"The significance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in colorectal cancer is unclear.
The single-cell sequencing data for colorectal cancer, specifically GSE132465 and GSE188711, were retrieved from the GEO database. Simultaneously, bulk transcriptome data were obtained from the UCSC Xena website. To delve into the heterogeneity of Treg cells and identify key genes at the single-cell sequencing level, we employed dimensionality reduction techniques alongside clustering and conducted differential expression gene analysis. For the bulk transcriptome data, we utilized weighted co-expression network analysis to investigate critical gene modules. Additionally, we employed COX regression and Lasso regression methodologies to construct prognostic models, thereby assessing patient outcomes. To facilitate outcome evaluation, nomograms were constructed. The integration of these diverse approaches aims to comprehensively study colorectal cancer, encompassing single-cell heterogeneity, key gene identification, and prognosis modeling using both single-cell and bulk transcriptome data. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments are used to verify mRNA expression levels of key genes. The analysis software was R software (version 4.3.2).
Through single-cell sequencing analysis and bulk transcriptome analysis, we constructed a prognostic model composed with Treg-associated signatures. The high-risk group demonstrated significantly worse prognosis compared with the low-risk group, highlighting the clinical relevance of our models. PCR confirmed that the key gene DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) was significantly overexpressed in colorectal cancer.
The prognostic models developed in this study offer a potential tool for risk assessment, guiding treatment decisions for colorectal cancer patients.","colorectal cancer"", ""prognosis"", ""regulatory T cells"", ""single‐cell sequencing"", ""transcriptome",2024-03-09

39,38262204,Weighted Combination of Łukasiewicz implication and Fuzzy Jaccard similarity in Hybrid Ensemble Framework (WCLFJHEF) for Gene Selection.,"A framework is developed for gene expression analysis by introducing fuzzy Jaccard similarity (FJS) and combining Łukasiewicz implication with it through weights in hybrid ensemble framework (WCLFJHEF) for gene selection in cancer. The method is called weighted combination of Łukasiewicz implication and fuzzy Jaccard similarity in hybrid ensemble framework (WCLFJHEF). While the fuzziness in Jaccard similarity is incorporated by using the existing Gödel fuzzy logic, the weights are obtained by maximizing the average F-score of selected genes in classifying the cancer patients. The patients are first divided into different clusters, based on the number of patient groups, using average linkage agglomerative clustering and a new score, called WCLFJ (weighted combination of Łukasiewicz implication and fuzzy Jaccard similarity). The genes are then selected from each cluster separately using filter based Relief-F and wrapper based SVMRFE (Support Vector Machine with Recursive Feature Elimination). A gene (feature) pool is created by considering the union of selected features for all the clusters. A set of informative genes is selected from the pool using sequential backward floating search (SBFS) algorithm. Patients are then classified using Naïve Bayes'(NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) separately, using the selected genes and the related F-scores are calculated. The weights in WCLFJ are then updated iteratively to maximize the average F-score obtained from the results of the classifier. The effectiveness of WCLFJHEF is demonstrated on six gene expression datasets. The average values of accuracy, F-score, recall, precision and MCC over all the datasets, are 95%, 94%, 94%, 94%, and 90%, respectively. The explainability of the selected genes is shown using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and this information is further used to rank them. The relevance of the selected gene set are biologically validated using the KEGG Pathway, Gene Ontology (GO), and existing literatures. It is seen that the genes that are selected by WCLFJHEF are candidates for genomic alterations in the various cancer types.

40,37950946,Dual regularized subspace learning using adaptive graph learning and rank constraint: Unsupervised feature selection on gene expression microarray datasets.,"High-dimensional problems have increasingly drawn attention in gene selection and analysis. To add insult to injury, usually the number of features is greater than number of samples in microarray gene dataset which leads to an ill-posed underdetermined equation system. Poor performance and high computational time for learning algorithms are consequences of redundant features in high-dimensional data. Feature selection is a noteworthy pre-processing method to ameliorate the curse of dimensionality with aim of maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy information preservation. Likewise, unsupervised feature selection has been important since collecting labels for data is expensive. In this paper, we develop a novel robust unsupervised feature selection to select discriminative subset of features for unlabeled data based on rank constrained and dual regularized nonnegative matrix factorization. The major focus of the proposed technique is to discard redundant features while keeping the informative features. Proposed feature selection technique consists of nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the data into feature weight matrix and representation matrix, inner product norm as regularization for both feature weight matrix and representation matrix, adaptive structure learning to preserve local information and Schatten-p norm as rank constraint. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical studies are conducted on six benchmark microarray datasets. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms eight state-of-art unsupervised feature selection techniques in terms of clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information.","Gene selection"", ""Inner product norm"", ""Local information preserving"", ""Microarray dataset"", ""Nonnegative matrix factorization"", ""Rank constraint"", ""Unsupervised feature selection",2023-11-12

20616034",Composite receptive fields in the mouse auditory cortex.,"A central question in sensory neuroscience is how neurons represent complex natural stimuli. This process involves multiple steps of feature extraction to obtain a condensed, categorical representation useful for classification and behaviour. It has previously been shown that central auditory neurons in the starling have composite receptive fields composed of multiple features. Whether this property is an idiosyncratic characteristic of songbirds, a group of highly specialized vocal learners or a generic property of sensory processing is unknown. To address this question, we have recorded responses from auditory cortical neurons in mice, and characterized their receptive fields using mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) as a natural and ethologically relevant stimulus and pitch-shifted starling songs as a natural but ethologically irrelevant control stimulus. We have found that these neurons display composite receptive fields with multiple excitatory and inhibitory subunits. Moreover, this was the case with either the conspecific or the heterospecific vocalizations. We then trained the sparse filtering algorithm on both classes of natural stimuli to obtain statistically optimal features, and compared the natural and artificial features using UMAP, a dimensionality-reduction algorithm previously used to analyse mouse USVs and birdsongs. We have found that the receptive-field features obtained with both types of the natural stimuli clustered together, as did the sparse-filtering features. However, the natural and artificial receptive-field features clustered mostly separately. Based on these results, our general conclusion is that composite receptive fields are not a unique characteristic of specialized vocal learners but are likely a generic property of central auditory systems. KEY POINTS: Auditory cortical neurons in the mouse have composite receptive fields with several excitatory and inhibitory features. Receptive-field features capture temporal and spectral modulations of natural stimuli. Ethological relevance of the stimulus affects the estimation of receptive-field dimensionality.","UMAP"", ""auditory cortex"", ""receptive field"", ""sparse filtering"", ""ultrasonic vocalizations",2023-08-14

28706271",Review of feature selection approaches based on grouping of features.,"With the rapid development in technology, large amounts of high-dimensional data have been generated. This high dimensionality including redundancy and irrelevancy poses a great challenge in data analysis and decision making. Feature selection (FS) is an effective way to reduce dimensionality by eliminating redundant and irrelevant data. Most traditional FS approaches score and rank each feature individually; and then perform FS either by eliminating lower ranked features or by retaining highly-ranked features. In this review, we discuss an emerging approach to FS that is based on initially grouping features, then scoring groups of features rather than scoring individual features. Despite the presence of reviews on clustering and FS algorithms, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first review focusing on FS techniques based on grouping. The typical idea behind FS through grouping is to generate groups of similar features with dissimilarity between groups, then select representative features from each cluster. Approaches under supervised, unsupervised, semi supervised and integrative frameworks are explored. The comparison of experimental results indicates the effectiveness of sequential, optimization-based (","Feature selection"", ""Feature grouping"", ""Integrative"", ""Supervised"", ""Unsupervised",2023-07-24

28091601",CellBRF: a feature selection method for single-cell clustering using cell balance and random forest.,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a powerful tool to dissect the complexity of biological tissues through cell sub-population identification in combination with clustering approaches. Feature selection is a critical step for improving the accuracy and interpretability of single-cell clustering. Existing feature selection methods underutilize the discriminatory potential of genes across distinct cell types. We hypothesize that incorporating such information could further boost the performance of single cell clustering.
We develop CellBRF, a feature selection method that considers genes' relevance to cell types for single-cell clustering. The key idea is to identify genes that are most important for discriminating cell types through random forests guided by predicted cell labels. Moreover, it proposes a class balancing strategy to mitigate the impact of unbalanced cell type distributions on feature importance evaluation. We benchmark CellBRF on 33 scRNA-seq datasets representing diverse biological scenarios and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of clustering accuracy and cell neighborhood consistency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the outstanding performance of our selected features through three case studies on cell differentiation stage identification, non-malignant cell subtype identification, and rare cell identification. CellBRF provides a new and effective tool to boost single-cell clustering accuracy.

35130179",A Feature Selection Method Based on Graph Theory for Cancer Classification.,"Gene expression profile data is a good data source for people to study tumors, but gene expression data has the characteristics of high dimension and redundancy. Therefore, gene selection is a very important step in microarray data classification.
In this paper, a feature selection method based on the maximum mutual information coefficient and graph theory is proposed. Each feature of gene expression data is treated as a vertex of the graph, and the maximum mutual information coefficient between genes is used to measure the relationship between the vertices to construct an undirected graph, and then the core and coritivity theory is used to determine the feature subset of gene data.
In this work, we used three different classification models and three different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC to evaluate the classification performance to avoid reliance on any one classifier or evaluation metric. The experimental results on six different types of genetic data show that our proposed algorithm has high accuracy and robustness compared to other advanced feature selection methods.
In this method, the importance and correlation of features are considered at the same time, and the problem of gene selection in microarray data classification is solved.","Gene expression"", ""MIC"", ""cancer classification"", ""feature selection"", ""filters."", ""graph theory",2023-04-15
45,36774889,Robust correlation estimation and UMAP assisted topological analysis of omics data for disease subtyping.,"Deciphering information hidden in the gene expression assays for identifying disease subtypes has significant importance in precision medicine. However, computational limitations thwart this process due to the intricacy of the biological networks and the curse of dimensionality of gene expression data. Therefore, clustering in such scenarios often becomes the first choice of exploratory data analysis to identify natural structures and intrinsic patterns in the data. However, sparse and high dimensional nature of omics data prevents conventional clustering algorithms to discover subtypes that are clinically relevant and statistically significant. Hence, non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques coupled with clustering in such scenarios often becomes imperative to improve the clustering results. In this study, we present a robust pipeline to discover disease subtypes with clinical relevance. Specifically, we focus on discovering patient sub-groups that have a residual life patterns remarkably different from other sub-groups. This is significant because by refining prognosis, subtyping can reduce uncertainty in approximating patients expected outcome. The methodology present is based on robust correlation estimation, UMAP- a non-linear dimensionality reduction method and mapper- a tool from topology. Notably, we suggest a method for improving the robustness of the correlation matrix of gene expression data for improving the clustering results. The performance of the model is evaluated by applying to five cancer datasets obtained through TCGA and comparisons are performed with some state of the art methods of NEMO, RSC-OTRI and SNF with regard to log-rank test and Restricted Life Expectancy Difference. For example in GBM dataset, the minimum separation for any two discovered subtypes is 221 days which is significantly higher than the other methodologies. We also compared the results without using the robust correlation based estimate and observed that robust correlation improves separability between survival curves significantly. From the results we infer that our methodology performs better compared to other methodologies with regard to separating survival curves of patient sub-groups despite using single omics profiles of patients compared to multiple omics profiles of SNF and NEMO. Pathway over-representation analysis is performed on the final clustering results to investigate the biological underpinnings characterizing each subtype.","Mapper"", ""Patient subtyping"", ""Robust correlation"", ""Survival analysis"", ""UMAP"", ""mRNA expression",2023-02-13

30979687",A cofunctional grouping-based approach for non-redundant feature gene selection in unannotated single-cell RNA-seq analysis.,"Feature gene selection has significant impact on the performance of cell clustering in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. A well-rounded feature selection (FS) method should consider relevance, redundancy and complementarity of the features. Yet most existing FS methods focus on gene relevance to the cell types but neglect redundancy and complementarity, which undermines the cell clustering performance. We develop a novel computational method GeneClust to select feature genes for scRNA-seq cell clustering. GeneClust groups genes based on their expression profiles, then selects genes with the aim of maximizing relevance, minimizing redundancy and preserving complementarity. It can work as a plug-in tool for FS with any existing cell clustering method. Extensive benchmark results demonstrate that GeneClust significantly improve the clustering performance. Moreover, GeneClust can group cofunctional genes in biological process and pathway into clusters, thus providing a means of investigating gene interactions and identifying potential genes relevant to biological characteristics of the dataset.

47,36470433,iRNA-ac4C: A novel computational method for effectively detecting N4-acetylcytidine sites in human mRNA.,"RNA N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) is the acetylation of cytidine at the nitrogen-4 position, which is a highly conserved RNA modification and involves a variety of biological processes. Hence, accurate identification of genome-wide ac4C sites is vital for understanding regulation mechanism of gene expression. In this work, a novel predictor, named iRNA-ac4C, was established to identify ac4C sites in human mRNA based on three feature extraction methods, including nucleotide composition, nucleotide chemical property, and accumulated nucleotide frequency. Subsequently, minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance combined with incremental feature selection strategies was utilized to select the optimal feature subset. According to the optimal feature subset, the best ac4C classification model was trained by gradient boosting decision tree with 10-fold cross-validation. The results of independent testing set indicated that our proposed method could produce encouraging generalization capabilities. For the convenience of other researchers, we established a user-friendly web server which is freely available at http://lin-group.cn/server/iRNA-ac4C/. We hope that the tool could provide guide for wet-experimental scholars.","Feature selection"", ""Gradient boosting decision tree"", ""Machine learning"", ""N4-acetylcytidine",2022-12-06

27543429",Characterization of spleen and lymph node cell types ,"The spleen and lymph nodes are important functional organs for human immune system. The identification of cell types for spleen and lymph nodes is helpful for understanding the mechanism of immune system. However, the cell types of spleen and lymph are highly diverse in the human body. Therefore, in this study, we employed a series of machine learning algorithms to computationally analyze the cell types of spleen and lymph based on single-cell CITE-seq sequencing data. A total of 28,211 cell data (training vs. test = 14,435 vs. 13,776) involving 24 cell types were collected for this study. For the training dataset, it was analyzed by Boruta and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) one by one, resulting in an mRMR feature list. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) method, incorporating four classification algorithms (deep forest, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and decision tree). Some essential features were discovered and the deep forest with its optimal features achieved the best performance. A group of related proteins (CD4, TCRb, CD103, CD43, and CD23) and genes (Nkg7 and Thy1) contributing to the classification of spleen and lymph nodes cell types were analyzed. Furthermore, the classification rules yielded by decision tree were also provided and analyzed. Above findings may provide helpful information for deepening our understanding on the diversity of cell types.","decision rule"", ""deep forest"", ""feature analysis"", ""machine learning algorithm"", ""spleen and lymph",2022-11-01

35949618",Polygenic risk modeling of tumor stage and survival in bladder cancer.,"Bladder cancer assessment with non-invasive gene expression signatures facilitates the detection of patients at risk and surveillance of their status, bypassing the discomforts given by cystoscopy. To achieve accurate cancer estimation, analysis pipelines for gene expression data (GED) may integrate a sequence of several machine learning and bio-statistical techniques to model complex characteristics of pathological patterns.
Numerical experiments tested the combination of GED preprocessing by discretization with tree ensemble embeddings and nonlinear dimensionality reductions to categorize oncological patients comprehensively. Modeling aimed to identify tumor stage and distinguish survival outcomes in two situations: complete and partial data embedding. This latter experimental condition simulates the addition of new patients to an existing model for rapid monitoring of disease progression. Machine learning procedures were employed to identify the most relevant genes involved in patient prognosis and test the performance of preprocessed GED compared to untransformed data in predicting patient conditions.
Data embedding paired with dimensionality reduction produced prognostic maps with well-defined clusters of patients, suitable for medical decision support. A second experiment simulated the addition of new patients to an existing model (partial data embedding): Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) methodology with uniform data discretization led to better outcomes than other analyzed pipelines. Further exploration of parameter space for UMAP and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) underlined the importance of tuning a higher number of parameters for UMAP rather than t-SNE. Moreover, two different machine learning experiments identified a group of genes valuable for partitioning patients (gene relevance analysis) and showed the higher precision obtained by preprocessed data in predicting tumor outcomes for cancer stage and survival rate (six classes prediction).
The present investigation proposed new analysis pipelines for disease outcome modeling from bladder cancer-related biomarkers. Complete and partial data embedding experiments suggested that pipelines employing UMAP had a more accurate predictive ability, supporting the recent literature trends on this methodology. However, it was also found that several UMAP parameters influence experimental results, therefore deriving a recommendation for researchers to pay attention to this aspect of the UMAP technique. Machine learning procedures further demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed preprocessing in predicting patients' conditions and determined a sub-group of biomarkers significant for forecasting bladder cancer prognosis.","Data-driven biomarker research"", ""Non-linear dimension reduction"", ""Polygenic risk modeling"", ""Tree ensemble embedding",2022-09-30

33954995",Identification of Adipocytokine Pathway-Related Genes in Epilepsy and Its Effect on the Peripheral Immune Landscape.,"Epilepsy is a multifactorial neurological disorder with recurrent epileptic seizures. Current research stresses both inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as enablers in the pathophysiological process of epilepsy. In view of the growing concern about the role of adipocytokines in antiepileptic and modulating immune responses, we aimed to investigate the relevance of the adipocytokine signaling pathway in the pathological process of epilepsy and its impacts on peripheral immune characteristics. In this study, expression profiles of 142 peripheral blood samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Adipocytokine pathway-related genes were screened out by feature selection using machine-learning algorithms. A nomogram was then constructed and estimated for the efficacy of diagnosis. Cluster analysis was employed for the recognization of two distinct epilepsy subtypes, followed by an estimation of the immune cell infiltration levels using single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The biological characteristics were analyzed by functional enrichment analysis. The aberrant regulation of adipocytokine signaling pathway was found in the peripheral blood of patients with epilepsy. Twenty-one differently expressed adipocytokine pathway-related genes were identified and five (RELA, PRKAB1, TNFRSF1A, CAMKK2, and CPT1B) were selected to construct a nomogram. Subsequent validations of its forecasting ability revealed that this model has satisfactory predictive value. The immune cell infiltration degrees, such as those of innate immune cells and lymphocytes, were found to significantly correlate to the levels of adipocytokine pathway-related genes. Additionally, 239 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and their biological functions were mainly enriched in the regulation of the immune response. In conclusion, our results confirmed the predictive value of adipocytokine pathway-related genes for epilepsy and explored their effects on immune infiltration, thereby improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy and providing assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.","adipocytokine pathway-related genes"", ""consensus clustering"", ""epilepsy"", ""nomogram"", ""peripheral immune infiltration"", ""random forest",2022-09-24

33488764",Detecting Brain Structure-Specific Methylation Signatures and Rules for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease that leads to irreversible behavioral changes, erratic emotions, and loss of motor skills. These conditions make people with AD hard or almost impossible to take care of. Multiple internal and external pathological factors may affect or even trigger the initiation and progression of AD. DNA methylation is one of the most effective regulatory roles during AD pathogenesis, and pathological methylation alterations may be potentially different in the various brain structures of people with AD. Although multiple loci associated with AD initiation and progression have been identified, the spatial distribution patterns of AD-associated DNA methylation in the brain have not been clarified. According to the systematic methylation profiles on different structural brain regions, we applied multiple machine learning algorithms to investigate such profiles. First, the profile on each brain region was analyzed by the Boruta feature filtering method. Some important methylation features were extracted and further analyzed by the max-relevance and min-redundancy method, resulting in a feature list. Then, the incremental feature selection method, incorporating some classification algorithms, adopted such list to identify candidate AD-associated loci at methylation with structural specificity, establish a group of quantitative rules for revealing the effects of DNA methylation in various brain regions (i.e., four brain structures) on AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, some efficient classifiers based on essential methylation sites were proposed to identify AD samples. Results revealed that methylation alterations in different brain structures have different contributions to AD pathogenesis. This study further illustrates the complex pathological mechanisms of AD.","Alzheimer’s disease"", ""DNA methylation"", ""brain structure"", ""machine learning"", ""quantitative rules",2022-05-20

56,35037023,sc-REnF: An entropy guided robust feature selection for single-cell RNA-seq data.,"Annotation of cells in single-cell clustering requires a homogeneous grouping of cell populations. Since single-cell data are susceptible to technical noise, the quality of genes selected prior to clustering is of crucial importance in the preliminary steps of downstream analysis. Therefore, interest in robust gene selection has gained considerable attention in recent years. We introduce sc-REnF [robust entropy based feature (gene) selection method], aiming to leverage the advantages of $R{\prime}{e}nyi$ and $Tsallis$ entropies in gene selection for single cell clustering. Experiments demonstrate that with tuned parameter ($q$), $R{\prime}{e}nyi$ and $Tsallis$ entropies select genes that improved the clustering results significantly, over the other competing methods. sc-REnF can capture relevancy and redundancy among the features of noisy data extremely well due to its robust objective function. Moreover, the selected features/genes can able to determine the unknown cells with a high accuracy. Finally, sc-REnF yields good clustering performance in small sample, large feature scRNA-seq data.

Thus, data mining methods for DNA microarray data classification usually involve samples consisting of thousands of genes. One of the efficient strategies to solve this problem is gene selection, which improves the accuracy of microarray data classification and also decreases computational complexity. In this paper, a novel social network analysis-based gene selection approach is proposed. The proposed method has two main objectives of the relevance maximization and redundancy minimization of the selected genes. In this method, on each iteration, a maximum community is selected repetitively. Then among the existing genes in this community, the appropriate genes are selected by using the node centrality-based criterion. The reported results indicate that the developed gene selection algorithm while increasing the classification accuracy of microarray data, will also decrease the time complexity.","Community detection"", ""Feature selection"", ""Gene selection"", ""Microarray data classification"", ""Multi-objective"", ""Node centrality",2022-01-10
58,34891654,HCNM: Heterogeneous Correlation Network Model for Multi-level Integrative Study of Multi-omics Data for Cancer Subtype Prediction.,"Integrative analysis of multi-omics data is important for biomedical applications, as it is required for a comprehensive understanding of biological function. Integrating multi-omics data serves multiple purposes, such as, an integrated data model, dimensionality reduction of omic features, patient clustering, etc. For oncological data, patient clustering is synonymous to cancer subtype prediction. However, there is a gap in combining some of the widely used integrative analyses to build more powerful tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a multi-level integration algorithm to identify representative integrative subspace and use it for cancer subtype prediction. The three integrative approaches we implement on multi-omics features are, (1) multivariate multiple (linear) regression of the features from a cohort of patients/samples, (2) network construction using different omics features, and (3) fusion of sample similarity networks across the features. We use a type of multilayer network, called heterogeneous network, as a data model to transition between a network-free (NF) regression model and a network-based (NB) model, which uses correlation networks. The heterogeneous networks consist of intra- and inter-layer graphs. Our proposed heterogeneous correlation network model, HCNM, is central to our algorithm for gene-ranking, integrative subspace identification, and tumor-specific subtypes prediction. The genes of our representative integrative subspace have been enriched with gene-ontology and found to exhibit significant gene-disease association (GDA) scores. The subspace in genes which is less than 5% of the total gene-set of each genomic feature is used with NB fusion integrative model to predict sample subtypes. As the identified integrative subspace data of multi-omics is less prone to noise, bias, and outliers, our experiments show that the subtypes in our results agree with previous benchmark studies and exhibit better classification between poor and good survival of patient cohorts.Clinical relevance: Finding significant cancer-specific genes and subtypes of cancer is vital for early prognosis, and personalized treatment; therefore, improves survival probability of a patient.","Community detection"", ""Feature selection"", ""Gene selection"", ""Microarray data classification"", ""Multi-objective"", ""Node centrality",2021-12-12

33535027",Dissecting Tumor Antigens and Immune Subtypes of Glioma to Develop mRNA Vaccine.,"Nowadays, researchers are leveraging the mRNA-based vaccine technology used to develop personalized immunotherapy for cancer. However, its application against glioma is still in its infancy. In this study, the applicable candidates were excavated for mRNA vaccine treatment in the perspective of immune regulation, and suitable glioma recipients with corresponding immune subtypes were further investigated.
The RNA-seq data and clinical information of 702 and 325 patients were recruited from TCGA and CGGA, separately. The genetic alteration profile was visualized and compared by cBioPortal. Then, we explored prognostic outcomes and immune correlations of the selected antigens to validate their clinical relevance. The prognostic index was measured 
Four glioma antigens, namely ANXA5, FKBP10, MSN, and PYGL, associated with superior prognoses and infiltration of APCs were selected. Three immune subtypes IS1-IS3 were identified, which fundamentally differed in molecular, cellular, and clinical signatures. Patients in subtypes IS2 and IS3 carried immunologically cold phenotypes, whereas those in IS1 carried immunologically hot phenotype. Particularly, patients in subtypes IS3 and IS2 demonstrated better outcomes than that in IS1. Expression profiles of immune checkpoints and immunogenic cell death (ICD) modulators showed a difference among IS1-IS3 tumors. Ultimately, the immune landscape of glioma elucidated considerable heterogeneity not only between individual patients but also within the same immune subtype.
ANXA5, FKBP10, MSN, and PYGL are identified as potential antigens for anti-glioma mRNA vaccine production, specifically for patients in immune subtypes 2 and 3. In summary, this study may shed new light on the promising approaches of immunotherapy, such as devising mRNA vaccination tailored to applicable glioma recipients.","glioma"", ""immune landscape"", ""immune subtypes"", ""mRNA vaccine"", ""tumor antigens",2021-09-14
60,34495838,Unsupervised Feature Selection Using an Integrated Strategy of Hierarchical Clustering With Singular Value Decomposition: An Integrative Biomarker Discovery Method With Application to Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised feature selection method by combining hierarchical feature clustering with singular value decomposition (SVD). The proposed algorithm first generates several feature clusters by adopting the hierarchical clustering on the feature space and then applies SVD to each of these feature clusters to find out the feature that contributes most to the SVD-entropy. The proposed feature selection method selects an optimal feature subset that not only minimizes the mutual dependency among the selected features but also maximizes the mutual dependency of the selected features against their nearest neighbor non-selected features to some extent. Each of the selected features also contributes the maximum SVD-entropy among all features of the same feature cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well against several state-of-the-art methods of feature selection in terms of various evaluation criteria such as classification accuracy, redundancy rate, and representation entropy. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) multi-omics data that consist of five datasets: gene expression, exon expression, methylation, microRNA, and pathway activity dataset (paradigm IPLs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our analysis pinpoints a candidate gene-marker, EREG for AML with an integrative omics evidence. EREG is targeted by two top ranked microRNAs, hsa-miR-1286 and hsa-miR-1976, here in the datasets. The method and results will be useful for biomarker discovery in the era of in precision medicine.","glioma"", ""immune landscape"", ""immune subtypes"", ""mRNA vaccine"", ""tumor antigens",2021-09-09

31380282",A systematic comparison of data- and knowledge-driven approaches to disease subtype discovery.,"Typical clustering analysis for large-scale genomics data combines two unsupervised learning techniques: dimensionality reduction and clustering (DR-CL) methods. It has been demonstrated that transforming gene expression to pathway-level information can improve the robustness and interpretability of disease grouping results. This approach, referred to as biological knowledge-driven clustering (BK-CL) approach, is often neglected, due to a lack of tools enabling systematic comparisons with more established DR-based methods. Moreover, classic clustering metrics based on group separability tend to favor the DR-CL paradigm, which may increase the risk of identifying less actionable disease subtypes that have ambiguous biological and clinical explanations. Hence, there is a need for developing metrics that assess biological and clinical relevance. To facilitate the systematic analysis of BK-CL methods, we propose a computational protocol for quantitative analysis of clustering results derived from both DR-CL and BK-CL methods. Moreover, we propose a new BK-CL method that combines prior knowledge of disease relevant genes, network diffusion algorithms and gene set enrichment analysis to generate robust pathway-level information. Benchmarking studies were conducted to compare the grouping results from different DR-CL and BK-CL approaches with respect to standard clustering evaluation metrics, concordance with known subtypes, association with clinical outcomes and disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. No single approach dominated every metric, showing the importance multi-objective evaluation in clustering analysis. However, we demonstrated that, on gene expression data sets derived from TCGA samples, the BK-CL approach can find groupings that provide significant prognostic value in both breast and prostate cancers.","cancer"", ""clustering"", ""multi-objective"", ""network analysis"", ""pathway enrichment analysis"", ""transcriptomics",2021-08-17
62,34311412,Feature level-based group lasso method for amnestic mild cognitive impairment diagnosis.,"Previous studies have indicated that brain morphological measures change in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, most existing classification methods cannot take full advantage of these measures. In this study, we improve traditional multitask learning framework by fully considering the relevance among related tasks and supplementary information from other unrelated tasks at the same time.
We propose a feature level-based group lasso (FL-GL) method in which a feature represents the average value of each ROI for each measure. First, we design a correlation matrix in which each row represents the relationship among different measures for each ROI. And this matrix is used to guide the feature selection based on a group lasso framework. Then, we train specific support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with the selected features for each measure. Finally, a weighted voting strategy is applied to combine these classifiers for a final prediction of aMCI from normal control (NC).
We use the leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to verify our method on two datasets, the Xuan Wu Hospital dataset and the ADNI dataset. Compared with the traditional method, the results show that the classification accuracies can be improved by 6.12 and 4.92% with the FL-GL method on the two datasets.
The results of an ablation study indicated that feature level-based group sparsity term was the core of our method. So, considering correlation at the feature level could improve the traditional multitask learning framework and our FL-GL method obtained better classification performance of patients with MCI and NCs.","Ensemble classification"", ""Feature level correlation"", ""Feature selection"", ""MCI"", ""Multitask learning",2021-07-27

32544615",Identifying COVID-19-Specific Transcriptomic Biomarkers with Machine Learning Methods.,"COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease caused by a new type of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has been spreading all over the world. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have no pathogenic symptoms, i.e., presymptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients. Both patients could further spread the virus to other susceptible people, thereby making the control of COVID-19 difficult. The two major challenges for COVID-19 diagnosis at present are as follows: (1) patients could share similar symptoms with other respiratory infections, and (2) patients may not have any symptoms but could still spread the virus. Therefore, new biomarkers at different omics levels are required for the large-scale screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. Although some initial analyses could identify a group of candidate gene biomarkers for COVID-19, the previous work still could not identify biomarkers capable for clinical use in COVID-19, which requires disease-specific diagnosis compared with other multiple infectious diseases. As an extension of the previous study, optimized machine learning models were applied in the present study to identify some specific qualitative host biomarkers associated with COVID-19 infection on the basis of a publicly released transcriptomic dataset, which included healthy controls and patients with bacterial infection, influenza, COVID-19, and other kinds of coronavirus. This dataset was first analysed by Boruta, Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy feature selection methods one by one, resulting in a feature list. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection method, incorporating one of the classification algorithms to extract essential biomarkers and build efficient classifiers and classification rules. The capacity of these findings to distinguish COVID-19 with other similar respiratory infectious diseases at the transcriptomic level was also validated, which may improve the efficacy and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Ensemble classification"", ""Feature level correlation"", ""Feature selection"", ""MCI"", ""Multitask learning",2021-07-27

27087918","Predicting phosphorylation sites using machine learning by integrating the sequence, structure, and functional information of proteins.","Post-translational modification (PTM) is a biological process that alters proteins and is therefore involved in the regulation of various cellular activities and pathogenesis. Protein phosphorylation is an essential process and one of the most-studied PTMs: it occurs when a phosphate group is added to serine (Ser, S), threonine (Thr, T), or tyrosine (Tyr, Y) residue. Dysregulation of protein phosphorylation can lead to various diseases-most commonly neurological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease-thus necessitating the prediction of S/T/Y residues that can be phosphorylated in an uncharacterized amino acid sequence. Despite a surplus of sequencing data, current experimental methods of PTM prediction are time-consuming, costly, and error-prone, so a number of computational methods have been proposed to replace them. However, phosphorylation prediction remains limited, owing to substrate specificity, performance, and the diversity of its features.
In the present study we propose machine-learning-based predictors that use the physicochemical, sequence, structural, and functional information of proteins to classify S/T/Y phosphorylation sites. Rigorous feature selection, the minimum redundancy/maximum relevance approach, and the symmetrical uncertainty method were employed to extract the most informative features to train the models.
The RF and SVM models generated using diverse feature types in the present study were highly accurate as is evident from good values for different statistical measures. Moreover, independent test sets and benchmark validations indicated that the proposed method clearly outperformed the existing methods, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict protein phosphorylation.
The results obtained in the present work indicate that the proposed computational methodology can be effectively used for predicting putative phosphorylation sites further facilitating discovery of various biological processes mechanisms.","MRMR"", ""Post-translational modification"", ""Random forest"", ""Support vector machine"", ""Symmetrical uncertainty",2021-05-26

A method for variable selection in multiblock analysis, called multiblock variable influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) is explained in this paper. MB-VIOP is a model based variable selection method that uses the data matrices, the scores and the normalized loadings of an OnPLS model in order to sort the input variables of more than two data matrices according to their importance for both simplification and interpretation of the total multiblock model, and also of the unique, local and global model components separately. MB-VIOP has been tested using three datasets: a synthetic four-block dataset, a real three-block omics dataset related to plant sciences, and a real six-block dataset related to the food industry.
We provide evidence for the usefulness and reliability of MB-VIOP by means of three examples (one synthetic and two real-world cases). MB-VIOP assesses in a trustable and efficient way the importance of both isolated and ranges of variables in any type of data. MB-VIOP connects the input variables of different data matrices according to their relevance for the interpretation of each latent variable, yielding enhanced interpretability for each OnPLS model component. Besides, MB-VIOP can deal with strong overlapping of types of variation, as well as with many data blocks with very different dimensionality. The ability of MB-VIOP for generating dimensionality reduced models with high interpretability makes this method ideal for big data mining, multi-omics data integration and any study that requires exploration and interpretation of large streams of data.","Feature selection"", ""Latent variable interpretation"", ""MB-VIOP"", ""Multiblock variable selection"", ""OnPLS"", ""VIP"", ""Variable importance in multiblock regression"", ""Variable influence on projection",2021-04-05

25018900",Molecular Diversity of Clinically Stable Human Kidney Allografts.,"Clinical decision and immunosuppression dosing in kidney transplantation rely on transplant biopsy tissue histology even though histology has low specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility for rejection diagnosis. The inclusion of stable allografts in mechanistic and clinical studies is vital to provide a normal, noninjured comparative group for all interrogative studies on understanding allograft injury.
To refine the definition of a stable allograft as one that is clinically, histologically, and molecularly quiescent using publicly available transcriptomics data.
In this prognostic study, the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus was used to search for microarray gene expression data from kidney transplant tissues, resulting in 38 studies from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018. The diagnostic annotations included 510 acute rejection (AR) samples, 1154 histologically stable (hSTA) samples, and 609 normal samples. Raw fluorescence intensity data were downloaded and preprocessed followed by data set merging and batch correction.
The primary measure was area under the receiver operating characteristics curve from a set of feature selected genes and cell types for distinguishing AR from normal kidney tissue.
Within the 28 data sets, the feature selection procedure identified a set of 6 genes (KLF4, CENPJ, KLF2, PPP1R15A, FOSB, TNFAIP3) (area under the curve [AUC], 0.98) and 5 immune cell types (CD4+ T-cell central memory [Tcm], CD4+ T-cell effector memory [Tem], CD8+ Tem, natural killer [NK] cells, and Type 1 T helper [TH1] cells) (AUC, 0.92) that were combined into 1 composite Instability Score (InstaScore) (AUC, 0.99). The InstaScore was applied to the hSTA samples: 626 of 1154 (54%) were found to be immune quiescent and redefined as histologically and molecularly stable (hSTA/mSTA); 528 of 1154 (46%) were found to have molecular evidence of rejection (hSTA/mAR) and should not have been classified as stable allografts. The validation on an independent cohort of 6 months of protocol biopsy samples in December 2019 showed that hSTA/mAR samples had a significant change in graft function (r = 0.52, P < .001) and graft loss at 5-year follow-up (r = 0.17). A drop by 10 mL/min/1.73m2 in estimated glomerular filtration rate was estimated as a threshold in allograft transitioning from hSTA/mSTA to hSTA/mAR.
The results of this prognostic study suggest that the InstaScore could provide an important adjunct for comprehensive and highly quantitative phenotyping of protocol kidney transplant biopsy samples and could be integrated into clinical care for accurate estimation of subsequent patient clinical outcomes.","Feature selection"", ""Latent variable interpretation"", ""MB-VIOP"", ""Multiblock variable selection"", ""OnPLS"", ""VIP"", ""Variable importance in multiblock regression"", ""Variable influence on projection",2021-01-26

31665429",Computational identification of N6-methyladenosine sites in multiple tissues of mammals.,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the methylation of the adenosine at the nitrogen-6 position, which is the most abundant RNA methylation modification and involves a series of important biological processes. Accurate identification of m6A sites in genome-wide is invaluable for better understanding their biological functions. In this work, an ensemble predictor named iRNA-m6A was established to identify m6A sites in multiple tissues of human, mouse and rat based on the data from high-throughput sequencing techniques. In the proposed predictor, RNA sequences were encoded by physical-chemical property matrix, mono-nucleotide binary encoding and nucleotide chemical property. Subsequently, these features were optimized by using minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method. Based on the optimal feature subset, the best m6A classification models were trained by Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 5-fold cross-validation test. Prediction results on independent dataset showed that our proposed method could produce the excellent generalization ability. We also established a user-friendly webserver called iRNA-m6A which can be freely accessible at http://lin-group.cn/server/iRNA-m6A. This tool will provide more convenience to users for studying m6A modification in different tissues.","Feature extraction and selection"", ""RNA modification"", ""Support vector machine"", ""Webserver"", ""m6A",2020-05-22

11453694",Identifying glycan motifs using a novel subtree mining approach.,"Glycans are complex sugar chains, crucial to many biological processes. By participating in binding interactions with proteins, glycans often play key roles in host-pathogen interactions. The specificities of glycan-binding proteins, such as lectins and antibodies, are governed by motifs within larger glycan structures, and improved characterisations of these determinants would aid research into human diseases. Identification of motifs has previously been approached as a frequent subtree mining problem, and we extend these approaches with a glycan notation that allows recognition of terminal motifs.
In this work, we customised a frequent subtree mining approach by altering the glycan notation to include information on terminal connections. This allows specific identification of terminal residues as potential motifs, better capturing the complexity of glycan-binding interactions. We achieved this by including additional nodes in a graph representation of the glycan structure to indicate the presence or absence of a linkage at particular backbone carbon positions. Combining this frequent subtree mining approach with a state-of-the-art feature selection algorithm termed minimum-redundancy, maximum-relevance (mRMR), we have generated a classification pipeline that is trained on data from a glycan microarray. When applied to a set of commonly used lectins, the identified motifs were consistent with known binding determinants. Furthermore, logistic regression classifiers trained using these motifs performed well across most lectins examined, with a median AUC value of 0.89.
We present here a new subtree mining approach for the classification of glycan binding and identification of potential binding motifs. The Carbohydrate Classification Accounting for Restricted Linkages (CCARL) method will assist in the interpretation of glycan microarray experiments and will aid in the discovery of novel binding motifs for further experimental characterisation.","Carbohydrate"", ""Frequent subtree mining"", ""Glycan"", ""Glycobiology"", ""Machine learning"", ""Microarray"", ""Motif",2020-02-06

26560078",A Computational Statistics Approach to Evaluate Blood Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Risk Stratification.,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among women. Mammography and tumor biopsy followed by histopathological analysis are the current methods to diagnose breast cancer. Mammography does not detect all breast tumor subtypes, especially those that arise in younger women or women with dense breast tissue, and are more aggressive. There is an urgent need to find circulating prognostic molecules and liquid biopsy methods for breast cancer diagnosis and reducing the mortality rate. In this study, we systematically evaluated metabolites and proteins in blood to develop a pipeline to identify potential circulating biomarkers for breast cancer risk. Our aim is to identify a group of molecules to be used in the design of portable and low-cost biomarker detection devices. We obtained plasma samples from women who are cancer free (healthy) and women who were cancer free at the time of blood collection but developed breast cancer later (susceptible). We extracted potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer risk from plasma metabolomics and proteomics data using statistical and discriminative power analyses. We pre-processed the data to ensure the quality of subsequent analyses, and used two main feature selection methods to determine the importance of each molecule. After further feature elimination based on pairwise dependencies, we measured the performance of logistic regression classifier on the remaining molecules and compared their biological relevance. We identified six signatures that predicted breast cancer risk with different specificity and selectivity. The best performing signature had 13 factors. We validated the difference in level of one of the biomarkers, SCF/KITLG, in plasma from healthy and susceptible individuals. These biomarkers will be used to develop low-cost liquid biopsy methods toward early identification of breast cancer risk and hence decreased mortality. Our findings provide the knowledge basis needed to proceed in this direction.","Breast cancer risk"", ""Circulating biomarker"", ""Feature selection"", ""Liquid biopsy"", ""Machine learning",2019-12-21

28404923",Ensemble of decision tree reveals potential miRNA-disease associations.,"In recent years, increasing associations between microRNAs (miRNAs) and human diseases have been identified. Based on accumulating biological data, many computational models for potential miRNA-disease associations inference have been developed, which saves time and expenditure on experimental studies, making great contributions to researching molecular mechanism of human diseases and developing new drugs for disease treatment. In this paper, we proposed a novel computational method named Ensemble of Decision Tree based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (EDTMDA), which innovatively built a computational framework integrating ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction. For each miRNA-disease pair, the feature vector was extracted by calculating the statistical measures, graph theoretical measures, and matrix factorization results for the miRNA and disease, respectively. Then multiple base learnings were built to yield many decision trees (DTs) based on random selection of negative samples and miRNA/disease features. Particularly, Principal Components Analysis was applied to each base learning to reduce feature dimensionality and hence remove the noise or redundancy. Average strategy was adopted for these DTs to get final association scores between miRNAs and diseases. In model performance evaluation, EDTMDA showed AUC of 0.9309 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and AUC of 0.8524 in local LOOCV. Additionally, AUC of 0.9192+/-0.0009 in 5-fold cross validation proved the model's reliability and stability. Furthermore, three types of case studies for four human diseases were implemented. As a result, 94% (Esophageal Neoplasms), 86% (Kidney Neoplasms), 96% (Breast Neoplasms) and 88% (Carcinoma Hepatocellular) of top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by experimental evidences in literature.","Breast cancer risk"", ""Circulating biomarker"", ""Feature selection"", ""Liquid biopsy"", ""Machine learning",2019-07-23

Based on the immune gene expression profiles of 1,368 patients with SCC in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we used consensus clustering to identify robust clusters of patients and assessed their reproducibility in an independent pan-SCC cohort of 938 patients. We further applied graph structure learning-based dimensionality reduction to the immune profiles to visualize the distribution of individual patients.
We identified and independently validated six reproducible immune subtypes associated with distinct molecular characteristics and clinical outcomes. An immune-cold subtype had the least amount of lymphocyte infiltration and a high level of aneuploidy, and these patients had the worst prognosis. By contrast, an immune-hot subtype demonstrated the highest infiltration of CD8

23893760",LJELSR: A Strengthened Version of JELSR for Feature Selection and Clustering.,"Feature selection and sample clustering play an important role in bioinformatics. Traditional feature selection methods separate sparse regression and embedding learning. Later, to effectively identify the significant features of the genomic data, Joint Embedding Learning and Sparse Regression (JELSR) is proposed. However, since there are many redundancy and noise values in genomic data, the sparseness of this method is far from enough. In this paper, we propose a strengthened version of JELSR by adding the L₁-norm constraint on the regularization term based on a previous model, and call it LJELSR, to further improve the sparseness of the method. Then, we provide a new iterative algorithm to obtain the convergence solution. The experimental results show that our method achieves a state-of-the-art level both in identifying differentially expressed genes and sample clustering on different genomic data compared to previous methods. Additionally, the selected differentially expressed genes may be of great value in medical research.","L1-norm"", ""differentially expressed genes"", ""feature selection"", ""sample clustering"", ""sparse constraint",2019-02-20
73,30596898,Single-cell RNA-seq interpretations using evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning.,"In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to discover cell types or even subtypes. Its increasing availability provides opportunities to identify cell populations from single-cell RNA-seq data. Computational methods have been employed to reveal the gene expression variations among multiple cell populations. Unfortunately, the existing ones can suffer from realistic restrictions such as experimental noises, numerical instability, high dimensionality and computational scalability.
We propose an evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning algorithm (EMEP) that addresses those realistic restrictions. Our EMEP algorithm first applies the unsupervised dimensionality reduction to project data from the original high dimensions to low-dimensional subspaces; basic clustering algorithms are applied in those new subspaces to generate different clustering results to form cluster ensembles. However, most of those cluster ensembles are unnecessarily bulky with the expense of extra time costs and memory consumption. To overcome that problem, EMEP is designed to dynamically select the suitable clustering results from the ensembles. Moreover, to guide the multiobjective ensemble evolution, three cluster validity indices including the overall cluster deviation, the within-cluster compactness and the number of basic partition clusters are formulated as the objective functions to unleash its cell type discovery performance using evolutionary multiobjective optimization. We applied EMEP to 55 simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including six single-cell RNA-seq dataset and one large-scale dataset with 3005 cells and 4412 genes. Two case studies are also conducted to reveal mechanistic insights into the biological relevance of EMEP. We found that EMEP can achieve superior performance over the other clustering algorithms, demonstrating that EMEP can identify cell populations clearly.
EMEP is written in Matlab and available at https://github.com/lixt314/EMEP.

74,30588879,Computational Method for Identifying Malonylation Sites by Using Random Forest Algorithm.,"As a newly uncovered post-translational modification on the ε-amino group of lysine residue, protein malonylation was found to be involved in metabolic pathways and certain diseases. Apart from experimental approaches, several computational methods based on machine learning algorithms were recently proposed to predict malonylation sites. However, previous methods failed to address imbalanced data sizes between positive and negative samples.
In this study, we identified the significant features of malonylation sites in a novel computational method which applied machine learning algorithms and balanced data sizes by applying synthetic minority over-sampling technique.
Four types of features, namely, amino acid (AA) composition, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), AA factor, and disorder were used to encode residues in protein segments. Then, a two-step feature selection procedure including maximum relevance minimum redundancy and incremental feature selection, together with random forest algorithm, was performed on the constructed hybrid feature vector.
An optimal classifier was built from the optimal feature subset, which featured an F1-measure of 0.356. Feature analysis was performed on several selected important features.
Results showed that certain types of PSSM and disorder features may be closely associated with malonylation of lysine residues. Our study contributes to the development of computational approaches for predicting malonyllysine and provides insights into molecular mechanism of malonylation.","Post-translational modification"", ""malonylation site"", ""maximum relevance minimum redundancy"", ""random forest"", ""synthetic minority over-sampling technique.",2018-12-28

27491548",A human body physiological feature selection algorithm based on filtering and improved clustering.,"The body composition model is closely related to the physiological characteristics of the human body. At the same time there can be a large number of physiological characteristics, many of which may be redundant or irrelevant. In existing human physiological feature selection algorithms, it is difficult to overcome the impact that redundancy and irrelevancy may have on human body composition modeling. This suggests a role for selection algorithms, where human physiological characteristics are identified using a combination of filtering and improved clustering. To do this, a feature filtering method based on Hilbert-Schmidt dependency criteria is first of all used to eliminate irrelevant features. After this, it is possible to use improved Chameleon clustering to increase the combination of sub-clusters amongst the characteristics, thereby removing any redundant features to obtain a candidate feature set for human body composition modeling. Method We report here on the use of an algorithm to filter the characteristic parameters in INBODY770 (this paper used INBODY 770 as body composition analyzer.) measurement data, which has three commonly-used impedance bands (1 kHZ, 250 kHZ, 500 kHZ). This algorithm is able to filter out parameters that have a low correlation with body composition BFM. The algorithm is also able to draw upon improved clustering techniques to reduce the initial feature set from 29 parameters to 10 parameters for any parameters of the 250 kHZ band that remain after filtering. In addition, we also examined the impact of different sample sizes on feature selection.
The proposed algorithm is able to remove irrelevant and redundant features and the resulting correlation between the model and the body composition (BFM which is a whole body fat evaluation can better assess the body's overall fat and muscle composition.) is 0.978, thereby providing an improved model for prediction with a relative error of less than 0.12.","Post-translational modification"", ""malonylation site"", ""maximum relevance minimum redundancy"", ""random forest"", ""synthetic minority over-sampling technique.",2018-11-01
76,29994260,"ELF: Extract Landmark Features By Optimizing Topology Maintenance, Redundancy, and Specificity.","Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of landmark features for model construction when there are many features and a comparatively few samples. The far-reaching development technologies such as biological sequencing at single cell level make feature selection a more challenging work. The difficulty lies in four facts: those features measured are in high dimension and with noise; dropouts make the data much sparse; many features are either redundant or irrelevant; and samples are not well-labeled in the experiments. Here, we propose a new model called ELF (Extract Landmark Features) to address the above challenges. ELF aims to simultaneously maximize topology maintenance to keep the pairwise relationships among samples, minimize feature redundancy to diversify the features, and maximize feature specificity to make every selected feature more representative. This makes ELF a nonlinear combinatorial optimization. To solve this difficult problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on greedy strategy. We show ELF's outstanding performance on two single cell RNA-seq datasets. One is the direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuron and the other is hepatoblast differentiation. ELF is able to choose only hundreds of landmark genes to maintain the cells' correlativity. Topology maintenance, redundancy removal, and specificity each plays its important role in selecting landmark features and revealing cells' biological functions. In addition, ELF can be generally applied in other scenarios. We demonstrate that ELF can reveal pivotal pixel in writing region and human face in two public image datasets. We believe that ELF is a useful tool to obtain more interpretable results by revealing key features while clustering the samples well.","Post-translational modification"", ""malonylation site"", ""maximum relevance minimum redundancy"", ""random forest"", ""synthetic minority over-sampling technique.",2018-07-12

29670502",Navigating features: a topologically informed chart of electromyographic features space.,"The success of biological signal pattern recognition depends crucially on the selection of relevant features. Across signal and imaging modalities, a large number of features have been proposed, leading to feature redundancy and the need for optimal feature set identification. A further complication is that, due to the inherent biological variability, even the same classification problem on different datasets can display variations in the respective optimal sets, casting doubts on the generalizability of relevant features. Here, we approach this problem by leveraging topological tools to create charts of features spaces. These charts highlight feature sub-groups that encode similar information (and their respective similarities) allowing for a principled and interpretable choice of features for classification and analysis. Using multiple electromyographic (EMG) datasets as a case study, we use this feature chart to identify functional groups among 58 state-of-the-art EMG features, and to show that they generalize across three different forearm EMG datasets obtained from able-bodied subjects during hand and finger contractions. We find that these groups describe meaningful non-redundant information, succinctly recapitulating information about different regions of feature space. We then recommend representative features from each group based on maximum class separability, robustness and minimum complexity.","EMG"", ""electromyogram"", ""feature extraction"", ""feature selection"", ""myoelectric control"", ""topological data analysis"", ""topological simplification",2017-12-08

18620558",A Gene selection approach based on the fisher linear discriminant and the neighborhood rough set.,"In recent years, tumor classification based on gene expression profiles has drawn great attention, and related research results have been widely applied to the clinical diagnosis of major gene diseases. These studies are of tremendous importance for accurate cancer diagnosis and subtype recognition. However, the microarray data of gene expression profiles have small samples, high dimensionality, large noise and data redundancy. To further improve the classification performance of microarray data, a gene selection approach based on the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) is proposed. First, the FLD method is employed to reduce the preliminarily genetic data to obtain features with a strong classification ability, which can form a candidate gene subset. Then, neighborhood precision and neighborhood roughness are defined in a neighborhood decision system, and the calculation approaches for neighborhood dependency and the significance of an attribute are given. A reduction model of neighborhood decision systems is presented. Thus, a gene selection algorithm based on FLD and NRS is proposed. Finally, four public gene datasets are used in the simulation experiments. Experimental results under the SVM classifier demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective, and it can select a smaller and more well-classified gene subset, as well as obtain better classification performance.","Fisher linear discriminant"", ""Gene selection"", ""neighborhood rough set"", ""reduction",2017-11-23

22425636",Discriminating cirRNAs from other lncRNAs using a hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) algorithm with feature selection.,"As non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs (cirRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted an increasing amount of attention. They have been confirmed to participate in many biological processes, including playing roles in transcriptional regulation, regulating protein-coding genes, and binding to RNA-associated proteins. Until now, the differences between these two types of non-coding RNAs have not been fully uncovered. It is still quite difficult to detect cirRNAs from other lncRNAs using simple techniques. In this study, we investigated these two types of non-coding RNAs using several computational methods. The purpose was to extract important factors that could distinguish cirRNAs from other lncRNAs and build an effective classification model to distinguish them. First, we collected cirRNAs, lncRNAs and their representations from a previous study, in which each cirRNA or lncRNA was represented by 188 features derived from its graph representation, sequence and conservation properties. Second, these features were analyzed by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method. The obtained mRMR feature list, incremental feature selection method and hierarchical extreme learning machine algorithm were employed to build an optimal classification model with sensitivity of 0.703, specificity of 0.850, accuracy of 0.789 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.561. Finally, we analyzed the 16 most important features. Of them, the sequences and structures of the RNA molecule were top ranking, implying they can be potential indicators of differences between cirRNAs and other lncRNAs. Meanwhile, other features of evolutionary conversation, sequence consecution were also important.","Hierarchical extreme learning machine algorithm"", ""Minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""cirRNAs"", ""lncRNAs",2017-09-16

19260470",RGIFE: a ranked guided iterative feature elimination heuristic for the identification of biomarkers.,"Current -omics technologies are able to sense the state of a biological sample in a very wide variety of ways. Given the high dimensionality that typically characterises these data, relevant knowledge is often hidden and hard to identify. Machine learning methods, and particularly feature selection algorithms, have proven very effective over the years at identifying small but relevant subsets of variables from a variety of application domains, including -omics data. Many methods exist with varying trade-off between the size of the identified variable subsets and the predictive power of such subsets. In this paper we focus on an heuristic for the identification of biomarkers called RGIFE: Rank Guided Iterative Feature Elimination. RGIFE is guided in its biomarker identification process by the information extracted from machine learning models and incorporates several mechanisms to ensure that it creates minimal and highly predictive features sets.
We compare RGIFE against five well-known feature selection algorithms using both synthetic and real (cancer-related transcriptomics) datasets. First, we assess the ability of the methods to identify relevant and highly predictive features. Then, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we look at the biological relevance of the identified biomarkers.
We propose RGIFE, a heuristic for the inference of reduced panels of biomarkers that obtains similar predictive performance to widely adopted feature selection methods while selecting significantly fewer feature. Furthermore, focusing on the case study, we show the higher biological relevance of the biomarkers selected by our approach.

21907292",Ensemble Classification of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Complex Graph Measures from Diffusion Tensor Images.,"The human brain is a complex network of interacting regions. The gray matter regions of brain are interconnected by white matter tracts, together forming one integrative complex network. In this article, we report our investigation about the potential of applying brain connectivity patterns as an aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We performed pattern analysis of graph theoretical measures derived from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data representing structural brain networks of 45 subjects, consisting of 15 patients of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 15 patients of MCI, and 15 healthy subjects (CT). We considered pair-wise class combinations of subjects, defining three separate classification tasks, i.e., AD-CT, AD-MCI, and CT-MCI, and used an ensemble classification module to perform the classification tasks. Our ensemble framework with feature selection shows a promising performance with classification accuracy of 83.3% for AD vs. MCI, 80% for AD vs. CT, and 70% for MCI vs. CT. Moreover, our findings suggest that AD can be related to graph measures abnormalities at Brodmann areas in the sensorimotor cortex and piriform cortex. In this way, node redundancy coefficient and load centrality in the primary motor cortex were recognized as good indicators of AD in contrast to MCI. In general, load centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality were found to be the most relevant network measures, as they were the top identified features at different nodes. The present study can be regarded as a ""proof of concept"" about a procedure for the classification of MRI markers between AD dementia, MCI, and normal old individuals, due to the small and not well-defined groups of AD and MCI patients. Future studies with larger samples of subjects and more sophisticated patient exclusion criteria are necessary toward the development of a more precise technique for clinical diagnosis.","Alzheimer's disease"", ""diffusion tensor images"", ""ensemble classification"", ""graph measures"", ""machine learning",2017-03-16

25806345",GSNFS: Gene subnetwork biomarker identification of lung cancer expression data.,"Gene expression has been used to identify disease gene biomarkers, but there are ongoing challenges. Single gene or gene-set biomarkers are inadequate to provide sufficient understanding of complex disease mechanisms and the relationship among those genes. Network-based methods have thus been considered for inferring the interaction within a group of genes to further study the disease mechanism. Recently, the Gene-Network-based Feature Set (GNFS), which is capable of handling case-control and multiclass expression for gene biomarker identification, has been proposed, partly taking into account of network topology. However, its performance relies on a greedy search for building subnetworks and thus requires further improvement. In this work, we establish a new approach named Gene Sub-Network-based Feature Selection (GSNFS) by implementing the GNFS framework with two proposed searching and scoring algorithms, namely gene-set-based (GS) search and parent-node-based (PN) search, to identify subnetworks. An additional dataset is used to validate the results.
The two proposed searching algorithms of the GSNFS method for subnetwork expansion are concerned with the degree of connectivity and the scoring scheme for building subnetworks and their topology. For each iteration of expansion, the neighbour genes of a current subnetwork, whose expression data improved the overall subnetwork score, is recruited. While the GS search calculated the subnetwork score using an activity score of a current subnetwork and the gene expression values of its neighbours, the PN search uses the expression value of the corresponding parent of each neighbour gene. Four lung cancer expression datasets were used for subnetwork identification. In addition, using pathway data and protein-protein interaction as network data in order to consider the interaction among significant genes were discussed. Classification was performed to compare the performance of the identified gene subnetworks with three subnetwork identification algorithms.
The two searching algorithms resulted in better classification and gene/gene-set agreement compared to the original greedy search of the GNFS method. The identified lung cancer subnetwork using the proposed searching algorithm resulted in an improvement of the cross-dataset validation and an increase in the consistency of findings between two independent datasets. The homogeneity measurement of the datasets was conducted to assess dataset compatibility in cross-dataset validation. The lung cancer dataset with higher homogeneity showed a better result when using the GS search while the dataset with low homogeneity showed a better result when using the PN search. The 10-fold cross-dataset validation on the independent lung cancer datasets showed higher classification performance of the proposed algorithms when compared with the greedy search in the original GNFS method.
The proposed searching algorithms provide a higher number of genes in the subnetwork expansion step than the greedy algorithm. As a result, the performance of the subnetworks identified from the GSNFS method was improved in terms of classification performance and gene/gene-set level agreement depending on the homogeneity of the datasets used in the analysis. Some common genes obtained from the four datasets using different searching algorithms are genes known to play a role in lung cancer. The improvement of classification performance and the gene/gene-set level agreement, and the biological relevance indicated the effectiveness of the GSNFS method for gene subnetwork identification using expression data.","Alzheimer's disease"", ""diffusion tensor images"", ""ensemble classification"", ""graph measures"", ""machine learning",2017-01-25
83,28000567,"Analysis and Prediction of Myristoylation Sites Using the mRMR Method, the IFS Method and an Extreme Learning Machine Algorithm.","Myristoylation is an important hydrophobic post-translational modification that is covalently bound to the amino group of Gly residues on the N-terminus of proteins. The many diverse functions of myristoylation on proteins, such as membrane targeting, signal pathway regulation and apoptosis, are largely due to the lipid modification, whereas abnormal or irregular myristoylation on proteins can lead to several pathological changes in the cell.
To better understand the function of myristoylated sites and to correctly identify them in protein sequences, this study conducted a novel computational investigation on identifying myristoylation sites in protein sequences.
A training dataset with 196 positive and 84 negative peptide segments were obtained. Four types of features derived from the peptide segments following the myristoylation sites were used to specify myristoylatedand non-myristoylated sites. Then, feature selection methods including maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (mRMR), incremental feature selection (IFS), and a machine learning algorithm (extreme learning machine method) were adopted to extract optimal features for the algorithm to identify myristoylation sites in protein sequences, thereby building an optimal prediction model.
As a result, 41 key features were extracted and used to build an optimal prediction model. The effectiveness of the optimal prediction model was further validated by its performance on a test dataset. Furthermore, detailed analyses were also performed on the extracted 41 features to gain insight into the mechanism of myristoylation modification.
This study provided a new computational method for identifying myristoylation sites in protein sequences. We believe that it can be a useful tool to predict myristoylation sites from protein sequences.","Post-translational modification"", ""extreme learning machine"", ""incremental feature selection"", ""minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""modified glycine residue"", ""myristoylation site prediction",2016-12-22

16936215",Replication and Relevance of Multiple Susceptibility Loci Discovered from Genome Wide Association Studies for Type 2 Diabetes in an Indian Population.,"Several genetic variants for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS) from Caucasian population; however replication studies were not consistent across various ethnicities. Objective of the current study is to examine the possible correlation of 9 most significant GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for T2D susceptibility as well as the interactive effect of these variants on the risk of T2D in an Indian population.
Case-control cohorts of 1156 individuals were genotyped for 9 SNPs from an Indian population. Association analyses were performed using logistic regression after adjusting for covariates. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was adopted to determine gene-gene interactions and discriminatory power of combined SNP effect was assessed by grouping individuals based on the number of risk alleles and by calculating area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC).
We confirm the association of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) and SLC30A8 (rs13266634) with T2D. MDR analysis showed statistically significant interactions among four SNPs of SLC30A8 (rs13266634), IGF2BP2 (rs4402960), HHEX (rs1111875) and CDKN2A (rs10811661) genes. Cumulative analysis showed an increase in odds ratio against the baseline group of individuals carrying 5 to 6 risk alleles and discriminatory power of genetic test based on 9 variants showed higher AUC value when analyzed along with body mass index (BMI).
These results provide a strong evidence for independent association between T2D and SNPs for in TCF7L2 and SLC30A8. MDR analysis demonstrates that independently non-significant variants may interact with one another resulting in increased disease susceptibility in the population tested.","Post-translational modification"", ""extreme learning machine"", ""incremental feature selection"", ""minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""modified glycine residue"", ""myristoylation site prediction",2016-06-17

24066079",Gene expression profiling gut microbiota in different races of humans.,"The gut microbiome is shaped and modified by the polymorphisms of microorganisms in the intestinal tract. Its composition shows strong individual specificity and may play a crucial role in the human digestive system and metabolism. Several factors can affect the composition of the gut microbiome, such as eating habits, living environment, and antibiotic usage. Thus, various races are characterized by different gut microbiome characteristics. In this present study, we studied the gut microbiomes of three different races, including individuals of Asian, European and American races. The gut microbiome and the expression levels of gut microbiome genes were analyzed in these individuals. Advanced feature selection methods (minimum redundancy maximum relevance and incremental feature selection) and four machine-learning algorithms (random forest, nearest neighbor algorithm, sequential minimal optimization, Dagging) were employed to capture key differentially expressed genes. As a result, sequential minimal optimization was found to yield the best performance using the 454 genes, which could effectively distinguish the gut microbiomes of different races. Our analyses of extracted genes support the widely accepted hypotheses that eating habits, living environments and metabolic levels in different races can influence the characteristics of the gut microbiome.","Post-translational modification"", ""extreme learning machine"", ""incremental feature selection"", ""minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""modified glycine residue"", ""myristoylation site prediction",2016-03-16

22999958",Analysis and Identification of Aptamer-Compound Interactions with a Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy and Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.,"The development of biochemistry and molecular biology has revealed an increasingly important role of compounds in several biological processes. Like the aptamer-protein interaction, aptamer-compound interaction attracts increasing attention. However, it is time-consuming to select proper aptamers against compounds using traditional methods, such as exponential enrichment. Thus, there is an urgent need to design effective computational methods for searching effective aptamers against compounds. This study attempted to extract important features for aptamer-compound interactions using feature selection methods, such as Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy, as well as incremental feature selection. Each aptamer-compound pair was represented by properties derived from the aptamer and compound, including frequencies of single nucleotides and dinucleotides for the aptamer, as well as the constitutional, electrostatic, quantum-chemical, and space conformational descriptors of the compounds. As a result, some important features were obtained. To confirm the importance of the obtained features, we further discussed the associations between them and aptamer-compound interactions. Simultaneously, an optimal prediction model based on the nearest neighbor algorithm was built to identify aptamer-compound interactions, which has the potential to be a useful tool for the identification of novel aptamer-compound interactions. The program is available upon the request.","Post-translational modification"", ""extreme learning machine"", ""incremental feature selection"", ""minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""modified glycine residue"", ""myristoylation site prediction",2016-03-10
87,26761857,A New Approach for Feature Selection from Microarray Data Based on Mutual Information.,"Mutual information (MI) is a powerful concept for correlation-centric applications. It has been used for feature selection from microarray gene expression data in many works. One of the merits of MI is that, unlike many other heuristic methods, it is based on a mature theoretic foundation. When applied to microarray data, however, it faces some challenges. First, due to the large number of features (i.e., genes) present in microarray data, the true distributions for the expression values of some genes may be distorted by noise. Second, evaluating inter-group mutual information requires estimating multi-variate distributions, which is quite difficult if not impossible. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a new MI-based feature selection approach for microarray data. Our approach relies on two strategies: one is relevance boosting, which requires a desirable feature to show substantially additional relevance with class labeling beyond the already selected features, the other is feature interaction enhancing, which probabilistically compensates for feature interaction missing from simple aggregation-based evaluation. We justify our approach from both theoretical perspective and experimental results. We use a synthetic dataset to show the statistical significance of the proposed strategies, and real-life datasets to show the improved performance of our approach over the existing methods.","Post-translational modification"", ""extreme learning machine"", ""incremental feature selection"", ""minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""modified glycine residue"", ""myristoylation site prediction",2016-01-14

19604602","iRDA: a new filter towards predictive, stable, and enriched candidate genes.","Gene expression profiling using high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies allows clinical researchers to find prognosis gene signatures that could better discriminate between different phenotypes and serve as potential biological markers in disease diagnoses. In recent years, many feature selection methods have been devised for finding such discriminative genes, and more recently information theoretic filters have also been introduced for capturing feature-to-class relevance and feature-to-feature correlations in microarray-based classification.
In this paper, we present and fully formulate a new multivariate filter, iRDA, for the discovery of HTS gene-expression candidate genes. The filter constitutes a four-step framework and includes feature relevance, feature redundancy, and feature interdependence in the context of feature-pairs. The method is based upon approximate Markov blankets, information theory, several heuristic search strategies with forward, backward and insertion phases, and the method is aiming at higher order gene interactions.
To show the strengths of iRDA, three performance measures, two evaluation schemes, two stability index sets, and the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) are all employed in our experimental studies. Its effectiveness has been validated by using seven well-known cancer gene-expression benchmarks and four other disease experiments, including a comparison to three popular information theoretic filters. In terms of classification performance, candidate genes selected by iRDA perform better than the sets discovered by the other three filters. Two stability measures indicate that iRDA is the most robust with the least variance. GSEA shows that iRDA produces more statistically enriched gene sets on five out of the six benchmark datasets.
Through the classification performance, the stability performance, and the enrichment analysis, iRDA is a promising filter to find predictive, stable, and enriched gene-expression candidate genes.","Post-translational modification"", ""extreme learning machine"", ""incremental feature selection"", ""minimum redundancy maximum relevance"", ""modified glycine residue"", ""myristoylation site prediction",2015-12-10
89,26298581,A Filter Feature Selection Method Based on MFA Score and Redundancy Excluding and It's Application to Tumor Gene Expression Data Analysis.,"Feature selection techniques have been widely applied to tumor gene expression data analysis in recent years. A filter feature selection method named marginal Fisher analysis score (MFA score) which is based on graph embedding has been proposed, and it has been widely used mainly because it is superior to Fisher score. Considering the heavy redundancy in gene expression data, we proposed a new filter feature selection technique in this paper. It is named MFA score+ and is based on MFA score and redundancy excluding. We applied it to an artificial dataset and eight tumor gene expression datasets to select important features and then used support vector machine as the classifier to classify the samples. Compared with MFA score, t test and Fisher score, it achieved higher classification accuracy.","Filter feature selection"", ""MFA score+"", ""Redundant features"", ""Tumor gene expression data",2015-08-25

Biomarkers that anticipate susceptibility, prognosis, or response to treatments are much needed. Oral cancer is a polygenic disease involving complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors, which require multifaceted analyses. Here, we examined in a dataset of 103 oral cancer cases and 98 controls from Taiwan the association between oral cancer risk and the DNA repair genes X-ray repair cross-complementing group (XRCCs) 1-4, and the environmental factors of smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid (BQ) chewing. We employed logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), and hierarchical interaction graphs for analyzing gene-gene (G×G) and gene-environment (G×E) interactions. We identified a significantly elevated risk of the XRCC2 rs2040639 heterozygous variant among smokers [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-12.1] and alcohol drinkers [adjusted OR=5.7, 95% CI=1.4-23.2]. The best two-factor based G×G interaction of oral cancer included the XRCC1 rs1799782 and XRCC2 rs2040639 [OR=3.13, 95% CI=1.66-6.13]. For the G×E interaction, the estimated OR of oral cancer for two (drinking-BQ chewing), three (XRCC1-XRCC2-BQ chewing), four (XRCC1-XRCC2-age-BQ chewing), and five factors (XRCC1-XRCC2-age-drinking-BQ chewing) were 32.9 [95% CI=14.1-76.9], 31.0 [95% CI=14.0-64.7], 49.8 [95% CI=21.0-117.7] and 82.9 [95% CI=31.0-221.5], respectively. Taken together, the genotypes of XRCC1 rs1799782 and XRCC2 rs2040639 DNA repair genes appear to be significantly associated with oral cancer. These were enhanced by exposure to certain environmental factors. The observations presented here warrant further research in larger study samples to examine their relevance for routine clinical care in oncology.","Filter feature selection"", ""MFA score+"", ""Redundant features"", ""Tumor gene expression data",2015-04-02

In general form of pseudo-amino acid composition, the protein sequences are used for constructing protein features. Here, the different amino acids compositions are used to construct the feature sets. Therefore, the data are presented as sample of protein versus amino acid compositions as features. The proposed algorithm tries to maximize the feature relevance and minimize the feature redundancy simultaneously. After proposed algorithm is executed on the multiclass dataset, some features are selected. On this resultant feature subset, tenfold cross-validation is applied and corresponding accuracy, F score, entropy, representation entropy and average correlation are calculated. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of its single objective versions, sequential forward search, sequential backward search, minimum redundancy maximum relevance with two schemes, CFS, CBFS, [Formula: see text], Fisher discriminant and a Cluster-based technique.","Filter feature selection"", ""MFA score+"", ""Redundant features"", ""Tumor gene expression data",2015-01-08
92,25512221,Classification of lung cancer using ensemble-based feature selection and machine learning methods.,"Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There are three major types of lung cancers, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and carcinoid. NSCLC is further classified into lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), squamous cell lung cancer (SQCLC) as well as large cell lung cancer. Many previous studies demonstrated that DNA methylation has emerged as potential lung cancer-specific biomarkers. However, whether there exists a set of DNA methylation markers simultaneously distinguishing such three types of lung cancers remains elusive. In the present study, ROC (Receiving Operating Curve), RFs (Random Forests) and mRMR (Maximum Relevancy and Minimum Redundancy) were proposed to capture the unbiased, informative as well as compact molecular signatures followed by machine learning methods to classify LADC, SQCLC and SCLC. As a result, a panel of 16 DNA methylation markers exhibits an ideal classification power with an accuracy of 86.54%, 84.6% and a recall 84.37%, 85.5% in the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and independent data set test experiments, respectively. Besides, comparison results indicate that ensemble-based feature selection methods outperform individual ones when combined with the incremental feature selection (IFS) strategy in terms of the informative and compact property of features. Taken together, results obtained suggest the effectiveness of the ensemble-based feature selection approach and the possible existence of a common panel of DNA methylation markers among such three types of lung cancer tissue, which would facilitate clinical diagnosis and treatment.","Filter feature selection"", ""MFA score+"", ""Redundant features"", ""Tumor gene expression data",2014-12-17

18438117",A feature selection method for classification within functional genomics experiments based on the proportional overlapping score.,"Microarray technology, as well as other functional genomics experiments, allow simultaneous measurements of thousands of genes within each sample. Both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of a classifier could be enhanced by performing the classification based only on selected discriminative genes. We propose a statistical method for selecting genes based on overlapping analysis of expression data across classes. This method results in a novel measure, called proportional overlapping score (POS), of a feature's relevance to a classification task.
We apply POS, along-with four widely used gene selection methods, to several benchmark gene expression datasets. The experimental results of classification error rates computed using the Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine classifiers show that POS achieves a better performance.
A novel gene selection method, POS, is proposed. POS analyzes the expressions overlap across classes taking into account the proportions of overlapping samples. It robustly defines a mask for each gene that allows it to minimize the effect of expression outliers. The constructed masks along-with a novel gene score are exploited to produce the selected subset of genes.","Filter feature selection"", ""MFA score+"", ""Redundant features"", ""Tumor gene expression data",2014-08-13

16402892",Application of genetic algorithms and constructive neural networks for the analysis of microarray cancer data.,"Extracting relevant information from microarray data is a very complex task due to the characteristics of the data sets, as they comprise a large number of features while few samples are generally available. In this sense, feature selection is a very important aspect of the analysis helping in the tasks of identifying relevant genes and also for maximizing predictive information.
Due to its simplicity and speed, Stepwise Forward Selection (SFS) is a widely used feature selection technique. In this work, we carry a comparative study of SFS and Genetic Algorithms (GA) as general frameworks for the analysis of microarray data with the aim of identifying group of genes with high predictive capability and biological relevance. Six standard and machine learning-based techniques (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), C-MANTEC Constructive Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Multilayer perceptron (MLP)) are used within both frameworks using six free-public datasets for the task of predicting cancer outcome.
Better cancer outcome prediction results were obtained using the GA framework noting that this approach, in comparison to the SFS one, leads to a larger selection set, uses a large number of comparison between genetic profiles and thus it is computationally more intensive. Also the GA framework permitted to obtain a set of genes that can be considered to be more biologically relevant. Regarding the different classifiers used standard feedforward neural networks (MLP), LDA and SVM lead to similar and best results, while C-MANTEC and k-NN followed closely but with a lower accuracy. Further, C-MANTEC, MLP and LDA permitted to obtain a more limited set of genes in comparison to SVM, NB and kNN, and in particular C-MANTEC resulted in the most robust classifier in terms of changes in the parameter settings.
This study shows that if prediction accuracy is the objective, the GA-based approach lead to better results respect to the SFS approach, independently of the classifier used. Regarding classifiers, even if C-MANTEC did not achieve the best overall results, the performance was competitive with a very robust behaviour in terms of the parameters of the algorithm, and thus it can be considered as a candidate technique for future studies.","Filter feature selection"", ""MFA score+"", ""Redundant features"", ""Tumor gene expression data",2014-08-01

Increasing availability of whole genome sequences provide the opportunity to explore the genetic foundations of a variety of functional traits. We proposed a machine learning framework to quantitatively link the genomic features with functional traits. Genes from bacteria genomes belonging to different functional traits were grouped to Cluster of Orthologs (COGs), and were used as features. Then, TF-IDF technique from the text mining domain was applied to transform the data to accommodate the abundance and importance of each COG. After TF-IDF processing, COGs were ranked using feature selection methods to identify their relevance to the functional trait of interest. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that functional trait related genes can be detected using our method. Further, the method has the potential to provide novel biological insights.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2014-07-06

In this article, the feature selection problem is organized as a graph-theoretic problem where a feature-dissimilarity graph is shaped from the data matrix. The nodes represent features and the edges represent their dissimilarity. Both nodes and edges are given weight according to the feature's relevance and dissimilarity among the features, respectively. The problem of finding relevant and non-redundant features is then mapped into densest subgraph finding problem. We have proposed a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm that optimizes average node-weight and average edge-weight of the candidate subgraph simultaneously.

97,24192119,Predicting drug-target interaction networks of human diseases based on multiple feature information.,"Drug-target interaction is crucial in the drug design process. Predicting the drug-target interaction networks of important human diseases can provide valuable clues for the characterization of the mechanism of action of diseases.
A new graph-based semisupervised learning (GBSSL) method is proposed to predict the drug-target interaction networks involved in 13 types of diseases. According to the method, each drug-target pair is initially described with different biological features including sequence, structure, function and network topology information. Then, the optimal feature selection procedures based on the relief and minimum redundancy maximum relevance are executed, respectively. Finally, unknown drug-target interactions can be predicted by the GBSSL method effectively.
The proposed method can effectively predict drug-target interactions (with a receiver operating characteristic score of 94.8% and a precision-recall score of 76.5%).
Compared with the existing methods, the GBSSL method provides an efficient means of generating optimal features obtained from the combination of multiple sources of feature information.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2013-11-07

16119262",Prediction of protein amidation sites by feature selection and analysis.,"Carboxy-terminal α-amidation is a widespread post-translational modification of proteins found widely in vertebrates and invertebrates. The α-amide group is required for full biological activity, since it may render a peptide more hydrophobic and thus better be able to bind to other proteins, preventing ionization of the C-terminus. However, in particular, the C-terminal amidation is very difficult to detect because experimental methods are often labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, in silico methods may complement due to their high efficiency. In this study, a computational method was developed to predict protein amidation sites, by incorporating the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method and the incremental feature selection method based on the nearest neighbor algorithm. From a total of 735 features, 41 optimal features were selected and were utilized to construct the final predictor. As a result, the predictor achieved an overall Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.8308. Feature analysis showed that PSSM conservation scores and amino acid factors played the most important roles in the α-amidation site prediction. Site-specific feature analyses showed that features derived from the amidation site itself and adjacent sites were most significant. This method presented could be used as an efficient tool to theoretically predict amidated peptides. And the selected features from our study could shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of the amidation modification, providing guidelines for experimental validation.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2013-06-25

However, resulting molecular marker sets comprised features with varying robustness and performance, depending on the dimension of training data. Thus, we investigated patterns that are inherent in large-scale data and suitable for feature selection in application to blood samples from septic patients. By integrating >300 microarray samples in correlation and enrichment analysis, we found general response patterns including a vast majority of co-expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes significantly mapped to immune response-associated categories and revealed strongly correlating upregulated genes related to antimicrobial functions. Classifiers using >20 uncorrelated features from enriched functional categories performed with 85% correct classification on average (10-fold cross-validation), comparable with correlated features, whilst single genes achieved up to 83% correct classifications in identifying septic patients. Independent interplatform comparison, however, validated only a subset of these features, including the antimicrobial cluster (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve >0.8). Based on these results, we propose feature selection for classification incorporating correlation and enriched functional categories to obtain robust marker candidates. Results of this transcriptomic meta-analysis suggest age-independent diagnostic opportunities, although further observational and animal interventional experiments are required to confirm the relevance of antimicrobial genes in sepsis.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2013-05-21

Dimensionality reduction is among the keys in mining high-dimensional 16S rRNAs' expression data. High levels of sparsity and redundancy are common in 16S rRNA gene microbial surveys. Traditional feature selection methods are generally restricted to measuring correlated abundances, and are limited in discrimination when so few microbes are actually shared across communities.
Here we present a Feature Merging and Selection algorithm (FMS) to deal with 16S rRNAs' expression data. By integrating Linear Discriminant Analysis method, FMS can reduce the feature dimension with higher accuracy and preserve the relationship between different features as well. Two 16S rRNAs' expression datasets of pneumonia and dental decay patients were used to test the validity of the algorithm. Combined with SVM, FMS discriminated different classes of both pneumonia and dental caries better than other popular feature selection methods.
FMS projects data into lower dimension with preservation of enough features, and thus improve the intelligibility of the result. The results showed that FMS is a more valid and reliable methods in feature reduction.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2013-01-11

19544191",Reduced set of virulence genes allows high accuracy prediction of bacterial pathogenicity in humans.,"Although there have been great advances in understanding bacterial pathogenesis, there is still a lack of integrative information about what makes a bacterium a human pathogen. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has dramatically increased the amount of completed bacterial genomes, for both known human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains; this information is now available to investigate genetic features that determine pathogenic phenotypes in bacteria. In this work we determined presence/absence patterns of 814 different virulence-related genes among more than 600 finished bacterial genomes from both human pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, belonging to different taxonomic groups (i.e: Actinobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, etc.). An accuracy of 95% using a cross-fold validation scheme with in-fold feature selection is obtained when classifying human pathogens and non-pathogens. A reduced subset of highly informative genes (120) is presented and applied to an external validation set. The statistical model was implemented in the BacFier v1.0 software (freely available at http : ==bacfier:googlecode:com=files=Bacfier v1 0:zip), that displays not only the prediction (pathogen/non-pathogen) and an associated probability for pathogenicity, but also the presence/absence vector for the analyzed genes, so it is possible to decipher the subset of virulence genes responsible for the classification on the analyzed genome. Furthermore, we discuss the biological relevance for bacterial pathogenesis of the core set of genes, corresponding to eight functional categories, all with evident and documented association with the phenotypes of interest. Also, we analyze which functional categories of virulence genes were more distinctive for pathogenicity in each taxonomic group, which seems to be a completely new kind of information and could lead to important evolutionary conclusions.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2012-08-24

11707607",A top-down approach to classify enzyme functional classes and sub-classes using random forest.,"Advancements in sequencing technologies have witnessed an exponential rise in the number of newly found enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze bio-chemical reactions and play an important role in metabolic pathways. Commonly, function of such enzymes is determined by experiments that can be time consuming and costly. Hence, a need for a computing method is felt that can distinguish protein enzyme sequences from those of non-enzymes and reliably predict the function of the former. To address this problem, approaches that cluster enzymes based on their sequence and structural similarity have been presented. But, these approaches are known to fail for proteins that perform the same function and are dissimilar in their sequence and structure. In this article, we present a supervised machine learning model to predict the function class and sub-class of enzymes based on a set of 73 sequence-derived features. The functional classes are as defined by International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Using an efficient data mining algorithm called random forest, we construct a top-down three layer model where the top layer classifies a query protein sequence as an enzyme or non-enzyme, the second layer predicts the main function class and bottom layer further predicts the sub-function class. The model reported overall classification accuracy of 94.87% for the first level, 87.7% for the second, and 84.25% for the bottom level. Our results compare very well with existing methods, and in many cases report better performance. Using feature selection methods, we have shown the biological relevance of a few of the top rank attributes.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2012-03-02
103,21919854,Analysis of metabolic pathway using hybrid properties.,"Given a compounds-forming system, i.e., a system consisting of some compounds and their relationship, can it form a biologically meaningful pathway? It is a fundamental problem in systems biology. Nowadays, a lot of information on different organisms, at both genetic and metabolic levels, has been collected and stored in some specific databases. Based on these data, it is feasible to address such an essential problem. Metabolic pathway is one kind of compounds-forming systems and we analyzed them in yeast by extracting different (biological and graphic) features from each of the 13,736 compounds-forming systems, of which 136 are positive pathways, i.e., known metabolic pathway from KEGG; while 13,600 were negative. Each of these compounds-forming systems was represented by 144 features, of which 88 are graph features and 56 biological features. ""Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance"" and ""Incremental Feature Selection"" were utilized to analyze these features and 16 optimal features were selected as being able to predict a query compounds- forming system most successfully. It was found through Jackknife cross-validation that the overall success rate of identifying the positive pathways was 74.26%.

104,21576180,Classification with correlated features: unreliability of feature ranking and solutions.,"Classification and feature selection of genomics or transcriptomics data is often hampered by the large number of features as compared with the small number of samples available. Moreover, features represented by probes that either have similar molecular functions (gene expression analysis) or genomic locations (DNA copy number analysis) are highly correlated. Classical model selection methods such as penalized logistic regression or random forest become unstable in the presence of high feature correlations. Sophisticated penalties such as group Lasso or fused Lasso can force the models to assign similar weights to correlated features and thus improve model stability and interpretability. In this article, we show that the measures of feature relevance corresponding to the above-mentioned methods are biased such that the weights of the features belonging to groups of correlated features decrease as the sizes of the groups increase, which leads to incorrect model interpretation and misleading feature ranking.
With simulation experiments, we demonstrate that Lasso logistic regression, fused support vector machine, group Lasso and random forest models suffer from correlation bias. Using simulations, we show that two related methods for group selection based on feature clustering can be used for correcting the correlation bias. These techniques also improve the stability and the accuracy of the baseline models. We apply all methods investigated to a breast cancer and a bladder cancer arrayCGH dataset and in order to identify copy number aberrations predictive of tumor phenotype.

19594431",Analysis of protein pathway networks using hybrid properties.,"Given a protein-forming system, i.e., a system consisting of certain number of different proteins, can it form a biologically meaningful pathway? This is a fundamental problem in systems biology and proteomics. During the past decade, a vast amount of information on different organisms, at both the genetic and metabolic levels, has been accumulated and systematically stored in various specific databases, such as KEGG, ENZYME, BRENDA, EcoCyc and MetaCyc. These data have made it feasible to address such an essential problem. In this paper, we have analyzed known regulatory pathways in humans by extracting different (biological and graphic) features from each of the 17,069 protein-formed systems, of which 169 are positive pathways, i.e., known regulatory pathways taken from KEGG; while 16,900 were negative, i.e., not formed as a biologically meaningful pathway. Each of these protein-forming systems was represented by 352 features, of which 88 are graph features and 264 biological features. To analyze these features, the ""Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance"" and the ""Incremental Feature Selection"" techniques were utilized to select a set of 22 optimal features to query whether a protein-forming system is able to form a biologically meaningful pathway or not. It was found through cross-validation that the overall success rate thus obtained in identifying the positive pathways was 79.88%.

12954615",A unified 35-gene signature for both subtype classification and survival prediction in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.,"Cancer subtype classification and survival prediction both relate directly to patients' specific treatment plans, making them fundamental medical issues. Although the two factors are interrelated learning problems, most studies tackle each separately. In this paper, expression levels of genes are used for both cancer subtype classification and survival prediction. We considered 350 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subjects, taken from four groups of patients (activated B-cell-like subtype dead, activated B-cell-like subtype alive, germinal center B-cell-like subtype dead, and germinal center B-cell-like subtype alive). As classification features, we used 11,271 gene expression levels of each subject. The features were first ranked by mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) principle and further selected by IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) procedure. Thirty-five gene signatures were selected after the IFS procedure, and the patients were divided into the above mentioned four groups. These four groups were combined in different ways for subtype prediction and survival prediction, specifically, the activated versus the germinal center and the alive versus the dead. Subtype prediction accuracy of the 35-gene signature was 98.6%. We calculated cumulative survival time of high-risk group and low-risk groups by the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test p-value was 5.98e-08. Our methodology provides a way to study subtype classification and survival prediction simultaneously. Our results suggest that for some diseases, especially cancer, subtype classification may be used to predict survival, and, conversely, survival prediction features may shed light on subtype features.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2010-09-22

18560586",UFFizi: a generic platform for ranking informative features.,"Feature selection is an important pre-processing task in the analysis of complex data. Selecting an appropriate subset of features can improve classification or clustering and lead to better understanding of the data. An important example is that of finding an informative group of genes out of thousands that appear in gene-expression analysis. Numerous supervised methods have been suggested but only a few unsupervised ones exist. Unsupervised Feature Filtering (UFF) is such a method, based on an entropy measure of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), ranking features and selecting a group of preferred ones.
We analyze the statistical properties of UFF and present an efficient approximation for the calculation of its entropy measure. This allows us to develop a web-tool that implements the UFF algorithm. We propose novel criteria to indicate whether a considered dataset is amenable to feature selection by UFF. Relying on formalism similar to UFF we propose also an Unsupervised Detection of Outliers (UDO) method, providing a novel definition of outliers and producing a measure to rank the ""outlier-degree"" of an instance.Our methods are demonstrated on gene and microRNA expression datasets, covering viral infection disease and cancer. We apply UFFizi to select genes from these datasets and discuss their biological and medical relevance.
Statistical properties extracted from the UFF algorithm can distinguish selected features from others. UFFizi is a framework that is based on the UFF algorithm and it is applicable for a wide range of diseases. The framework is also implemented as a web-tool.The web-tool is available at: http://adios.tau.ac.il/UFFizi.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2010-06-08
108,19764809,Identifying protein complexes using hybrid properties.,"Protein complexes, integrating multiple gene products, perform all sorts of fundamental biological functions in cells. Much effort has been put into identifying protein complexes using computational approaches. A vast majority attempt to research densely connected regions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) network/graph. In this research, we try an alterative approach to analyze protein complexes using hybrid features and present a method to determine whether multiple (more than two) proteins from yeast can form a protein complex. The data set consists of 493 positive protein complexes and 9878 negative protein complexes. Every complex is represented by graph features, where proteins in the complex form a graph (web) of interactions, and features derived from biological properties including protein length, biochemical properties and physicochemical properties. These features are filtered and optimized by Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance method, Incremental Feature Selection and Forward Feature Selection, established through a prediction/identification model called Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. Jackknife cross-validation test is employed to evaluate the identification accuracy. As a result, the highest accuracy for the identification of the real protein complexes using filtered features is 69.17%, and feature analysis shows that, among the adopted features, graph features play the main roles in the determination of protein complexes.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2009-09-22

However, in order to improve the performance of reverse engineering and statistical inference procedures aimed to estimate gene-gene connectivity links, some kind of regularization is usually needed to reduce the overall data complexities, together with ad hoc feature selection to uncover biologically relevant gene associations. The paper deals with feature selection by projective methods; in particular, it addresses some issues: Can the impact of noise on the data be limited by shrinkage or de-noising? How can complexity from convoluted dynamics associated with microarray measurements be discounted? In modeling such data, how to deal with over-parametrization, and control it? The problem of aliasing is then discussed and classified into two categories according to the trade-off between biological relevance and noise, and finally reported in analytical form via subspace analysis.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2009-07-28

We applied the model to an ovarian tumor data set to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors. The performance of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and gave an overall accuracy over 85%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.887 which compares well with existing methods. The method presented here is significant because of its ability to handle missing values, and it only uses a small number of variables which are graded according to their discriminative relevance. This, together with the fact that the resulting model is interpretable and has good performance, is likely to lead to widespread clinical acceptance of the method. The method is also generic and can be readily adapted for other classifications problems in biomedicine.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2007-11-21
111,16278950,An integrated feature selection and classification method to select minimum number of variables on the case study of gene expression data.,"This paper introduces a novel generic approach for classification problems with the objective of achieving maximum classification accuracy with minimum number of features selected. The method is illustrated with several case studies of gene expression data. Our approach integrates filter and wrapper gene selection methods with an added objective of selecting a small set of non-redundant genes that are most relevant for classification with the provision of bins for genes to be swapped in the search for their biological relevance. It is capable of selecting relatively few marker genes while giving comparable or better leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy when compared with gene ranking selection approaches. Additionally, gene profiles can be extracted from the evolving connectionist system, which provides a set of rules that can be further developed into expert systems. The approach uses an integration of Pearson correlation coefficient and signal-to-noise ratio methods with an adaptive evolving classifier applied through the leave-one-out method for validation. Datasets of gene expression from four case studies are used to illustrate the method. The results show the proposed approach leads to an improved feature selection process in terms of reducing the number of variables required and an increased in classification accuracy.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2005-11-10
112,12614549,Distinguishing features of 16S rDNA gene for five dominating bacterial genus observed in bioremediation.,"Defining a microbial community and identifying bacteria, at least at the genus level, is a first step in predicting the behavior of a microbial community in bioremediation. In biological treatment systems, the most dominating groups observed are Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Acinetobactor, Burkholderia, and Alcaligenes. Our interest lies in identifying the distinguishing features of these bacterial groups based on their 16S rDNA sequence data, which could be used further for generating genus-specific probes. Accordingly, 20 sequences representing different species from each genus above were retrieved, which constituted a training set. A 16-dimensional feature vector comprised of transition probabilities of nucleotides was considered and each sampled sequence was expressed in terms of these features. A stepwise feature selection method was used to identify features that are distinct across the species of these five groups. Wilk's lambda selection criterion was used and resulted in a subset with six distinguishing features. The discriminating efficacy of this subset was tested through multiple group discriminant analysis. Two linear composites, as a function of these features, could discriminate the test set of forty-five sequences from these groups with 95% accuracy, thereby ascertaining the relevance of the identified features. The geometric representation of feature correlation in the reduced discriminant space demonstrated the dominance of identified features in specific groups. These features independently or in combination could be used to generate genus-specific patterns to design probes, so as to develop a tracking tool for the selected group of bacteria.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2003-03-05

114,11473022,CLIFF: clustering of high-dimensional microarray data via iterative feature filtering using normalized cuts.,"We present CLIFF, an algorithm for clustering biological samples using gene expression microarray data. This clustering problem is difficult for several reasons, in particular the sparsity of the data, the high dimensionality of the feature (gene) space, and the fact that many features are irrelevant or redundant. Our algorithm iterates between two computational processes, feature filtering and clustering. Given a reference partition that approximates the correct clustering of the samples, our feature filtering procedure ranks the features according to their intrinsic discriminability, relevance to the reference partition, and irredundancy to other relevant features, and uses this ranking to select the features to be used in the following round of clustering. Our clustering algorithm, which is based on the concept of a normalized cut, clusters the samples into a new reference partition on the basis of the selected features. On a well-studied problem involving 72 leukemia samples and 7130 genes, we demonstrate that CLIFF outperforms standard clustering approaches that do not consider the feature selection issue, and produces a result that is very close to the original expert labeling of the sample set.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2001-07-27
115,11242594,Identifying marker genes in transcription profiling data using a mixture of feature relevance experts.,"Transcription profiling experiments permit the expression levels of many genes to be measured simultaneously. Given profiling data from two types of samples, genes that most distinguish the samples (marker genes) are good candidates for subsequent in-depth experimental studies and developing decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. This work proposes a mixture of feature relevance experts as a method for identifying marker genes and illustrates the idea using published data from samples labeled as acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (ALL, AML). A feature relevance expert implements an algorithm that calculates how well a gene distinguishes samples, reorders genes according to this relevance measure, and uses a supervised learning method [here, support vector machines (SVMs)] to determine the generalization performances of different nested gene subsets. The mixture of three feature relevance experts examined implement two existing and one novel feature relevance measures. For each expert, a gene subset consisting of the top 50 genes distinguished ALL from AML samples as completely as all 7,070 genes. The 125 genes at the union of the top 50s are plausible markers for a prototype decision support system. Chromosomal aberration and other data support the prediction that the three genes at the intersection of the top 50s, cystatin C, azurocidin, and adipsin, are good targets for investigating the basic biology of ALL/AML. The same data were employed to identify markers that distinguish samples based on their labels of T cell/B cell, peripheral blood/bone marrow, and male/female. Selenoprotein W may discriminate T cells from B cells. Results from analysis of transcription profiling data from tumor/nontumor colon adenocarcinoma samples support the general utility of the aforementioned approach. Theoretical issues such as choosing SVM kernels and their parameters, training and evaluating feature relevance experts, and the impact of potentially mislabeled samples on marker identification (feature selection) are discussed.","bacteria genomes"", ""bioinformatics"", ""feature mapping"", ""feature selection"", ""functional genomics"", ""functional traits"", ""genes"", ""genome sequences"", ""genomic features"", ""genomic signatures"", ""machine learning"", ""microbial diversity"", ""phenotype–genotype association"", ""sporulation",2001-03-10
